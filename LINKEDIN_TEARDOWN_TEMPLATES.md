## Template 1: The Salary Reveal

### Post:

I asked ChatGPT: "What's the salary for a Senior Engineer at [COMPANY]?"

It said: £55,000-£70,000.

The actual salary? £75,000-£95,000.

That's a £20K gap. Every candidate who reads that AI answer either:
→ Doesn't apply (thinks you underpay)
→ Anchors their negotiation £20K too low

Here's the thing: AI isn't lying. It's guessing. Because [COMPANY] hasn't published salary bands anywhere AI can find them.

One paragraph on a careers page fixes this.

We audited 340+ UK employers. 68% have the same problem.

## Template 2: The Interview Prep Test

### Post:

Try this experiment:

Open ChatGPT. Type: "Help me prepare for an interview at [your company]"

I did this for [WELL-KNOWN UK EMPLOYER].

Here's what candidates see before they walk into your office:

[Screenshot of AI response]

❌ The process description is from a 2024 Glassdoor review
❌ It suggests a take-home test (they switched to pair programming)
❌ It doesn't mention their values or what they look for

Every candidate who prepares using this arrives underprepared.

The fix? Publish your interview process. One page. 300 words. AI picks it up within 2 weeks.

Companies like Monzo already do this. When you ask AI about a Monzo interview, it cites Monzo's own careers page.

Your candidates are asking AI. The question is whether AI gives them your version or someone else's.

## Template 3: The Competitor Comparison

### Post:

I ran AI employer audits on two UK [INDUSTRY] companies:

[COMPANY A]: 67/100
[COMPANY B]: 29/100

The difference isn't brand spend. It isn't Glassdoor reviews.

[COMPANY A] published 3 things on their careers site:
1. Salary framework
2. Benefits breakdown
3. Interview process FAQ

[COMPANY B] has a careers page with job listings. Nothing else.

When candidates ask AI about [COMPANY A], AI cites their own content.
When candidates ask about [COMPANY B], AI guesses using Glassdoor and Reddit.

Same industry. Same size. Completely different AI narrative.

The irony? [COMPANY B] reportedly pays better and has stronger benefits. But candidates never find that out — because it's not published anywhere AI can find it.

## Template 4: The "Try This Right Now" Hook

### Post:

Stop scrolling and try this.

Open ChatGPT (or Perplexity, or Claude).

Type: "What benefits does [your company] offer?"

Read what comes back.

If you're in HR, TA, or employer branding — this is what your candidates see.

I've run this test for 340+ UK employers. Here's what I've found:

→ 68% have no published benefits data AI can cite
→ AI defaults to "standard pension" and "25 days leave" — even when the real package is worth £15K+ more
→ Companies that DO publish benefits on their careers page get cited within weeks

The gap between what you offer and what AI says you offer might be the most expensive blind spot in talent acquisition right now.

## Template 5: The Data Drop

### Post:

We audited 340+ UK employers across every AI model.

The results are grim:

📊 Average AI Visibility Score: 32/100
📊 68% have no machine-readable salary data
📊 72% have no interview process documented for AI
📊 Only 14% have structured benefits content
📊 Fintech leads (avg 47/100). Retail trails (avg 24/100).

The pattern is clear: employers that publish factual, structured content on their careers pages get cited by AI. Those that don't get Glassdoor's best guess.

The good news? This is fixable. A single blog post moved one employer from 0% to 11% AI visibility in 2 weeks.

We're building a public UK Employer AI Visibility Index. If you want your company included (free), drop a comment or DM me.

## Template 6: The "Shocking Quote" Format

### Post:

"Based on available data, a Senior Product Designer at [COMPANY] likely earns between £45,000–£55,000."

— ChatGPT, February 2026

The actual salary: £70,000–£85,000.

I showed this to [COMPANY]'s Head of TA. Her response:

"We've been wondering why we can't attract senior designers. Now I know."

This is the AI employer brand gap. The distance between what you actually offer and what AI tells candidates you offer.

For most UK employers, it's enormous.

The fix is surprisingly simple. But first, you need to see the gap.

## Posting Guidelines

### Algorithm optimisation:
- First line = hook (stop the scroll)
- Line breaks every 1-2 sentences
- Use → and bullet points, not numbered lists
- End with a question or CTA
- Reply to every comment within 2 hours (signals engagement to algorithm)
- Tag the company ONLY if you've said something positive about them

### Image/screenshot guidelines:
- Include a screenshot of the actual AI response where possible
- Annotate with red circles/arrows highlighting inaccuracies
- Use consistent branding (OpenRole watermark in corner)
- Native LinkedIn image uploads get 2x reach vs link posts

### What to post vs what NOT to post:
✅ Well-known UK employers (people recognise the name)
✅ Industries with active LinkedIn audiences (tech, fintech, consulting)
✅ Salary discrepancies (everyone clicks on salary content)
✅ Interview prep gaps (hiring managers care about this viscerally)
✅ Specific, concrete, data-backed claims

❌ Naming companies that would be embarrassed (be respectful)
❌ Generic "AI is changing everything" thought leadership
❌ Long paragraphs without line breaks
❌ Links in the main post body (put in first comment)
❌ More than 3 hashtags

### Hashtags (use 2-3, in first comment):
#EmployerBranding #TalentAcquisition #AISearch #HiringStrategy #RecruitmentMarketing #HRTech
