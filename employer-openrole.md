# OpenRole: Take Back Your Reputation from AI

> **In 2026, AI answers questions about your company before you do. If you're not controlling that answer, someone else is — and they're getting it wrong.**

---

## The Problem Every Employer Faces

When a candidate wants to know what it's like working at your company, they no longer Google you and read ten links. They ask ChatGPT. Or Claude. Or Perplexity. And those AI tools give them a single, confident answer — stitched together from Glassdoor reviews, old Reddit threads, outdated job postings, and whatever else they can scrape.

**That answer is almost certainly wrong.**

Here's what's happening right now, whether you know it or not:

- **AI is guessing your salaries.** A candidate asks "What does a Senior Developer earn at [Your Company]?" and gets a number pulled from a 2023 Glassdoor submission by someone who left unhappy. Your actual 2026 range might be £20k higher. You'll never know the candidate ruled you out.

- **Your jobs are invisible.** Most career pages output messy code that AI can't read. When someone asks an AI agent to "find me marketing jobs in Manchester," yours don't appear — not because they don't exist, but because the AI literally can't parse your page.

- **Old reviews define you.** That 2.8-star Glassdoor rating from three years ago, before you changed leadership, revamped benefits, and raised salaries? AI treats it as current fact. There's no mechanism to correct the record.

The result: **you're losing candidates before they ever visit your careers page**, and you have no visibility into it happening.

## Why Glassdoor Can't Fix This

Glassdoor built a business on a simple exchange: employees share anonymous salary data, and in return they get access to everyone else's. It was the best candidates had.

But Glassdoor has three fundamental problems that OpenRole solves:

**1. The data is self-reported and unverified.**
Anyone can submit a salary. There's no check against reality. A bitter leaver submitting £45k for a role that actually pays £70k looks identical to an accurate submission. AI agents don't know the difference — they just average it all together.

**2. The data goes stale.**
Glassdoor has no freshness mechanism. A salary submitted in 2022 carries the same weight as one from last month. For AI agents scraping this data, "Senior Developer at Company X earns £55k" might be three years out of date — but it's the number candidates see.

**3. Companies have no voice.**
Glassdoor gives employers a response feature for reviews, but no way to publish verified compensation data that overrides outdated submissions. The company that raised salaries 30% last year looks identical to the one that didn't.

**OpenRole flips this entirely.** We give employers a verified channel to publish their own data — not on Glassdoor's platform, but directly into the AI data stream. When AI agents look for information about your company, they find your verified facts first.

## How OpenRole Works

OpenRole is a lightweight tool that sits on your careers page and feeds verified company data directly to AI agents. No developers needed. No IT tickets. Your marketing or HR team can set it up in under five minutes.

### What happens when you install OpenRole:

**Step 1: You tell us the truth.**
Through a simple dashboard, your HR team enters verified company information — salary ranges (as broad or specific as you choose), benefits, culture details, working policies. Think of it as your company's official fact sheet.

**Step 2: We translate it for AI.**
OpenRole converts your facts into structured data that AI agents are built to read. It's the difference between handing someone a neatly organised folder versus throwing a stack of papers at them.

**Step 3: AI agents find your facts first.**
Every piece of data from OpenRole carries a verification badge and a freshness timestamp. When ChatGPT or Claude looks for information about your company, they prioritise this — it's newer, it's verified, and it's in the exact format they prefer.

**Step 4: You see what's working.**
Every Monday morning, you receive a report showing exactly where AI cited your company, what it got right, what it corrected, and how your visibility compares to last week.

### What you don't have to do:

- ❌ Change your website code
- ❌ Involve your IT department
- ❌ Replace your existing recruitment tools
- ❌ Publish exact salary figures (unless you want to)

## The Shadow Salary Problem

Here's something most employers don't realise: **AI already publishes salary estimates for your roles.** It doesn't wait for your permission.

When a candidate asks "What does a Product Manager earn at [Your Company]?", AI constructs an answer from:
- Glassdoor submissions (often years old, unverified)
- Indeed salary estimates (algorithmic guesses)
- Old job postings that may have listed ranges
- Reddit discussions and anonymous forums
- General market data loosely applied to your company

The result is what we call a **Shadow Salary** — the number AI thinks you pay, which may bear no resemblance to what you actually pay.

### A real scenario:

> **Candidate asks ChatGPT:** "What's the salary for a Senior Engineer at Acme Corp?"
>
> **ChatGPT responds:** "Based on available data, Senior Engineers at Acme Corp typically earn between £55,000–£68,000."
>
> **Acme Corp's actual 2026 range:** £75,000–£95,000
>
> **What happens:** The candidate doesn't apply. They never visit the careers page. Acme never knows they lost them. The AI got it wrong by £20k, and there was no mechanism to correct it.

This is happening to thousands of companies right now. The only question is whether you can see it.

**OpenRole shows you your Shadow Salary** — the exact numbers AI agents are giving candidates about you — and gives you the tools to correct the record with verified data.

## You Choose How Much to Share

Not every company wants to publish exact salary figures. That's fine. OpenRole gives you four levels of disclosure — you pick what suits your culture and legal requirements:

### Level 1 — Verified Employer
*"We've verified our data with OpenRole."*

No salary information required. You're simply telling AI agents: "This company actively manages its employment data. Our facts are current." This alone puts you ahead of the 95% of companies that give AI nothing to work with.

**Best for:** Companies that want to start small, or in markets with no transparency requirements.

### Level 2 — Range Verified
*"We pay competitively, and here's the proof."*

You share broad salary bands (e.g., "£60k–£100k for engineering roles") and a Compensation Confidence indicator — a signal that tells candidates and AI agents you're in the top tier for your market, without revealing exact figures.

**Best for:** Companies that want to counter Glassdoor's guesswork without full disclosure.

### Level 3 — Full Transparency
*"Here's exactly what we pay, by role, level, and location."*

Detailed salary ranges for every position. This is where companies in New York, California, Colorado, and (from June 2026) the EU will need to be. OpenRole automates the compliance — it knows which jurisdictions require what, and formats your data accordingly.

**Best for:** Companies in regulated markets, or those using transparency as a competitive advantage.

### Level 4 — Total Compensation Intelligence
*"Salary is just the start. Here's the full picture."*

Full salary ranges plus benefits valuation, equity details, flexible working policies, learning budgets, parental leave — everything that makes up the real value of working for you. Most of this data is invisible to AI today. Level 4 makes it the first thing candidates see.

**Best for:** Companies whose benefits package is a genuine differentiator.

## The Compensation Confidence Score

Most companies can't — or won't — share exact salary figures. We built something for them.

The **Compensation Confidence Score** is a verified signal that tells AI agents and candidates three things:

1. **This data is employer-verified.** Not self-reported by an anonymous reviewer, but confirmed by the company itself.
2. **This data is current.** Timestamped to the day. AI agents prioritise fresh data over stale estimates.
3. **This company pays competitively.** A market positioning indicator (e.g., "Top 30% for this role in this location") without revealing the number.

Think of it as a credit score for employer reputation. Candidates see it and know the company takes compensation seriously. AI agents see it and cite it over Glassdoor's guesses. And the company never had to publish a single salary figure.

## What AI Gets Wrong (And Why It Matters)

To understand why OpenRole matters, you need to understand how AI agents construct answers about your company.

When someone asks ChatGPT about working at your company, it doesn't have a file on you. It assembles an answer in real-time from whatever data it can find. It prioritises:

1. **Structured data** it can read easily (almost no companies provide this)
2. **Recent content** with clear dates (Glassdoor reviews, news articles)
3. **Popular sources** with high engagement (Reddit threads, viral reviews)
4. **General market data** when company-specific data is thin

The problem: **most companies provide nothing in category 1**, so AI falls back to categories 2–4, which are unreliable, outdated, and often hostile.

OpenRole puts you squarely in **category 1**. Your verified, structured, timestamped data becomes the primary source. Everything else becomes secondary — or irrelevant.

### What OpenRole corrects:

| What AI says today | What OpenRole injects | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Salary from a 2022 Glassdoor review | Your verified 2026 salary range or Compensation Confidence Score | Candidates see accurate compensation |
| "Hybrid working" based on a 2023 policy | Your current flexible working arrangement | Candidates know your actual policy |
| Benefits pulled from an old job ad | Your full 2026 benefits package — equity, healthcare, parental leave | Total compensation becomes visible |
| Generic company description | Your verified culture, values, and team information | Your employer brand, in your words |
| Nothing (your jobs are invisible) | Structured job listings AI can actually read | Your roles appear in AI job searches |

## Pay Transparency Is Coming Whether You're Ready or Not

Even if salary disclosure feels optional today, regulation is moving fast:

- **New York City** — Salary ranges required on all job postings (active now)
- **California** — Salary disclosure mandatory for companies with 15+ employees (active now)
- **Colorado** — Statewide mandatory salary posting (active now)
- **European Union** — Pay Transparency Directive takes effect June 2026, covering all EU member states

Companies operating across jurisdictions face a patchwork of rules that change constantly. OpenRole tracks these automatically — it knows which of your roles need salary ranges, in which locations, and formats the data accordingly.

For companies already in regulated markets, OpenRole turns a compliance headache into a competitive advantage. For those in unregulated markets, it's preparation for what's coming — and in the meantime, it solves the AI visibility problem that's costing you candidates today.

## The Bigger Picture: Why This Matters Now

We're in the early days of a fundamental shift in how people find jobs. The old model — job boards, Google searches, LinkedIn browsing — is being replaced by AI-mediated discovery. Candidates don't search for jobs. They ask AI to find them.

Companies that structure their data for this new reality will attract better candidates, faster. Companies that don't will watch their talent pipeline shrink without understanding why.

Glassdoor built the last generation's solution: crowdsourced salary data for a world where candidates did their own research. OpenRole builds this generation's solution: **verified employer data for a world where AI does the research for them.**

The question isn't whether to manage your AI reputation. It's whether you start now — while you can shape the narrative — or later, when the narrative has already been written for you.

---

## The Network Effect

Every company that joins OpenRole makes the platform more valuable for everyone:

- **Better benchmarking.** More verified salary data means more accurate market comparisons. HR teams can see how they stack up — based on real, employer-verified numbers, not Glassdoor's guesswork.
- **Stronger AI trust signals.** As more companies publish verified data through OpenRole, AI agents learn to treat it as a primary source. The network becomes the standard.
- **Smarter compliance.** Patterns across thousands of companies help OpenRole predict regulatory changes, flag emerging risks, and refine its automation.

Over time, OpenRole becomes the most accurate real-time employment data source in existence — verified by employers, not estimated by algorithms or reported by anonymous individuals. That's the future Glassdoor can't build, because their model depends on employees, not employers.

*OpenRole — Because if AI doesn't know the truth about your company, it'll make something up.*
