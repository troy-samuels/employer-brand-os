# OpenRole — Domain Authority Flywheel Plan

**Created:** 23 February 2026
**Status:** In progress — sub-agents executing #1 and #2

---

## Current State

- **Domain:** openrole.co.uk (DA ~0, brand new)
- **Technical SEO:** ✅ Solid (JSON-LD, sitemaps, canonicals, robots.txt)
- **Content:** Thin — blog has limited posts, 15 industry index pages, free tools
- **Backlinks:** Zero
- **Indexed pages:** Unknown — Google may not have indexed yet

---

## Flywheel 1: Shareable Audit Pages + Embed Badges

**Status:** 🔄 Sub-agent building now

**What:** Every company audited gets a public profile at `/company/[slug]` with:
- Full OG/Twitter metadata for social sharing
- Share buttons (Copy Link, LinkedIn, Twitter)
- Embeddable SVG badge for careers pages
- "Claim this profile" CTA for conversion

**Why:** Each audited company page is a potential backlink. If 1% of 500 audited companies embed the badge, that's 5 backlinks from employer careers pages — high-authority, relevant links.

**Metric:** # of badge embeds, # of social shares, # of "claim" clicks

## Flywheel 2: Batch Audit Top 500 UK Employers

**Status:** 🔄 Sub-agent building infrastructure

**What:** 
1. Extract top 500 UK employers from our 44K company database (by contact count)
2. Programmatically audit each one
3. Populate `/uk-index` pages with real rankings
4. Generate industry reports

**Why:** Creates 500+ indexed pages with unique data. Each is a potential search result for "[company] employer brand" or "[company] AI visibility". Also provides stats for content marketing.

**Content to generate from the data:**
- "State of AI Employer Visibility: UK 2026" (flagship report)
- Industry breakdowns (Fintech, NHS, Retail, Tech, Legal, etc.)
- "Top 20 most AI-visible UK employers"
- "Which FTSE 250 companies are invisible to AI?"
- Blog posts with specific data points

**Metric:** # of indexed pages, organic impressions, click-through rate

## Flywheel 4: Community Presence (Reddit + LinkedIn)

**Status:** 📋 Ready to start

### Reddit Strategy

**Target Subreddits:**
| Subreddit | Members | Activity | Angle |
|-----------|---------|----------|-------|
| r/humanresources | ~150K | Active daily | "Here's what AI says about employers" insights |
| r/recruiting | ~200K | Very active | "AI is changing candidate research" |
| r/UKJobs | ~100K | Active | UK-specific employer brand insights |
| r/recruitinghell | ~500K | Very active | "Why candidates ghost you" data |
| r/AskHR | ~200K | Active | Answer questions with data |
| r/careerguidance | ~1M+ | Very active | "How AI is changing job research" |
| r/antiwork | ~2.5M | Very active | "Companies scoring 0 on AI transparency" angle |

**Content types (NOT promotional — value-first):**
1. **Data drops:** "I analysed what AI says about 500 UK employers. Here's what I found." (r/humanresources, r/recruiting)
2. **Helpful answers:** When someone asks about employer research, mention AI search as a factor
3. **Discussion starters:** "Has anyone noticed candidates mentioning what ChatGPT told them about your company?" (r/recruiting)
4. **AMA potential:** Once we have solid data from batch audits

**Rules:**
- Never link to OpenRole in the first 5-10 posts
- Build karma and credibility first
- Only mention OpenRole when directly relevant and asked
- Focus on being genuinely helpful with data
- UK-focused angle differentiates from US-centric content

### LinkedIn Strategy

**Profile needed:** Troy Samuels or OpenRole company page

**Content cadence:** 2-3 posts per week
1. **Data insights:** "We audited 500 UK employers. The average AI visibility score was X/100." (with graphic)
2. **Hot takes:** "Your EVP cost £50K. ChatGPT doesn't know it exists."
3. **Case examples:** "When I asked ChatGPT about [company], here's what it said..." (anonymised or with permission)
4. **Engagement:** Comment on employer brand / TA / HR posts with data-backed insights

**Action Required:**
- [ ] Malcolm: Start Reddit presence (r/humanresources, r/recruiting) — observe first, then contribute
- [ ] Troy: Decide on LinkedIn approach (personal brand vs company page vs both)
- [ ] Malcolm: Draft first 3 Reddit posts once batch audit data is available
