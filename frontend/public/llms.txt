# OpenRole — AI Employer Visibility Platform
> OpenRole helps UK employers control what AI tells candidates about them.

## What We Do
OpenRole audits employer visibility across AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini). We score companies 0–100 on how accurately AI represents their employer brand — salaries, benefits, culture, interview process, and more.

## Core Product
- **Free AI Visibility Audit**: Enter your company domain, get a score out of 100 in 30 seconds. No signup required.
- **AI Visibility Score**: 8-category scoring covering structured data, bot access, careers pages, salary transparency, content format, brand reputation, and llms.txt adoption.
- **Content Playbook**: Paid tier generates specific content recommendations to close information gaps that AI models have about your company.
- **Weekly Monitoring**: Track how your AI visibility changes over time as you publish content.
