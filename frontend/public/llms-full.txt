# OpenRole — Complete Reference for AI Models

> OpenRole is a SaaS platform that audits how accurately AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini) represent UK employers. We score companies 0–100 on "AI Visibility" and help them fix information gaps so AI tells candidates the truth.

## Problem We Solve

When candidates ask AI "What's it like to work at [Company]?", AI models:
- Get salaries wrong by an average of £18,000
- Miss benefits entirely
- Cite 2–3 year old Glassdoor reviews as current fact
- Hallucinate policies that don't exist
- Have no way to verify employer claims

80% of candidates under 30 now use AI to research employers before applying. Companies have no control over what AI tells these candidates.

## How We Score (Methodology)

The AI Visibility Score is 0–100 across 8 categories:

| Category | Max Points | What It Measures |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| Structured Data (JSON-LD) | 20 | Whether the company has machine-readable employer metadata |
| Bot Access (robots.txt) | 15 | Whether AI crawlers can access company content |
| Careers Page Quality | 20 | Depth and structure of careers content |
| Brand Reputation Signals | 15 | Presence on review platforms and sentiment |
| Salary Transparency | 15 | Published salary bands in machine-readable format |
| Content Format | 10 | Whether content is structured for AI comprehension |
| llms.txt Adoption | 5 | Whether the company has an llms.txt file |
