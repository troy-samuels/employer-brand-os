## 📧 Email Sequence Design

### Sequence 1: "The Invisible Employer" (Decision Makers)
**Goal:** Book audit demos, drive enterprise signups

#### Email 1: Awareness (Day 0)
**Subject:** "{{companyName}} is invisible to AI hiring assistants"

**Body:**
```
{{firstName}},

I searched for "best {{industry}} employers in {{city}}" using ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude.

{{companyName}} didn't appear in any of their answers.

Your competitors did.

Here's what that means:
• 68% of job seekers now use AI to find employers
• If AI doesn't know you exist, neither do top candidates
• Your talent acquisition costs are about to skyrocket

Want to see exactly how AI sees your employer brand?

Free audit: [Link]

Takes 60 seconds. Results in 2 minutes.

```

**CTA:** Free audit link (tracked)

---

#### Email 2: Social Proof (Day 3)
**Subject:** "How Sofology fixed their AI visibility in 48h"

**Body:**
```
{{firstName}},

Quick follow-up — did you get a chance to run the audit?

I ask because we just helped Sofology (furniture retailer, 1000+ employees) fix a critical issue:

**Before:** Mentioned in 0/15 AI hiring queries  
**After:** Cited in 12/15 queries, +180% applicant quality

The fix took 48 hours.

Their Head of People said:  
> "We were spending £40K/mo on job ads no one saw. OpenRole made us visible to the candidates who actually matter."

See your own results: [Audit Link]

Best,
Troy
```

**CTA:** Audit + case study link

---

#### Email 3: Urgency (Day 7)
**Subject:** "Last chance: Free AI employer audit ({{companyName}})"

**Body:**
```
{{firstName}},

This is the last time I'll reach out about this.

The free AI employer audit I mentioned is still available, but we're limiting it to 100 companies this month.

Here's why this matters *now*:

1. **Q1 hiring budgets** are being allocated this month
2. **67% of February applicants** used AI to research employers (LinkedIn data)
3. **Your competitors** are already optimizing for AI visibility

3 clicks. 60 seconds. Know exactly where you stand.

[Run Free Audit]

If AI hiring doesn't matter to your strategy, just reply "not relevant" and I'll stop bothering you.

Cheers,
Troy
```

**CTA:** Audit link + unsubscribe option

---

### Sequence 2: "The Hiring Benchmark" (Managers)
**Goal:** Drive self-service signups, build awareness

#### Email 1: Curiosity (Day 0)
**Subject:** "Your AI employer brand score: __ / 100"

**Body:**
```
Hi {{firstName}},

Quick question: What score would ChatGPT give {{companyName}}'s employer brand?

A) 80-100 (Excellent)  
B) 60-79 (Good)  
C) 40-59 (Needs work)  
D) 0-39 (Invisible)

Most HR teams guess B or C.

The reality? **73% score below 40.**

Find out where you really stand: [Free Audit]

```

**CTA:** Free audit

---

#### Email 2: Education (Day 5)
**Subject:** "Why job ads aren't working anymore"

**Body:**
```
{{firstName}},

Remember when posting on Indeed was enough?

Those days are over.

**The new reality:**
- 68% of candidates start with AI (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude)
- They ask: "Who are the best employers in [industry]?"
- AI answers based on *online reputation*, not ad spend
- If your employer brand isn't optimized, **you're invisible**

This is why your cost-per-hire keeps rising.

See how AI sees you: [Audit Link]

It's free. Takes 60 seconds.

```

**CTA:** Audit link

### Sequence 3: "The Transparency Play" (Volume)
**Goal:** Mass awareness, viral sharing, data collection

#### Email 1: Simple Value (Day 0)
**Subject:** "Free AI employer brand report"

**Body:**
```
Hi {{firstName}},

Free tool for HR teams:

**OpenRole AI Audit**

**CTA:** Free audit (self-service)

## 🔒 Compliance & Legal (CRITICAL)

### GDPR Compliance (UK/EU Contacts)

#### Lawful Basis: Legitimate Interest
We're using **legitimate interest** as our legal basis under GDPR Article 6(1)(f).

**Justification:**
- Contacts are business professionals in HR/recruiting roles
- Emails are work addresses (not personal)
- Content is relevant to their professional responsibilities
- Minimal privacy impact (B2B context)

**Requirements:**
1. ✅ **Legitimate Interest Assessment (LIA)** — Document business need
2. ✅ **Easy opt-out** — Every email includes unsubscribe
3. ✅ **Privacy notice** — Link to data processing disclosure
4. ✅ **Data minimization** — Only send to relevant segments
5. ✅ **Suppression list** — Honor unsubscribes immediately

**Red Lines:**
- ❌ NO personal/consumer email addresses
- ❌ NO sensitive data processing
- ❌ NO automated decision-making claims
- ❌ NO deceptive subject lines
- ❌ NO sending after unsubscribe request

---

### PECR (UK-Specific)

**Applies to:** Electronic marketing in the UK

**Requirements:**
1. ✅ **Corporate emails OK** — B2B exemption (Regulation 22)
2. ✅ **Unsubscribe in every email** — Must be "simple means"
3. ✅ **Sender identification** — Real name, company, address
4. ✅ **No disguised marketing** — Subject must be honest

**Our Approach:**
- All UK contacts are work emails (B2B exemption applies)
- Clear "Unsubscribe" link in footer
- Sender: "Troy Goldman, OpenRole Ltd"
- Physical address: [Troy's registered UK business address]

---

### CAN-SPAM (US Contacts)

**Requirements:**
1. ✅ **No false headers** — Real "From" name and email
2. ✅ **Honest subject lines** — No deception
3. ✅ **Identify as ad** — (Optional for B2B, but we'll do it anyway)
4. ✅ **Physical address** — In email footer
5. ✅ **Opt-out mechanism** — Must honor within 10 business days
6. ✅ **Monitor unsubscribes** — Can't send after opt-out

**Our Approach:**
- Footer includes: "This is a marketing email. Unsubscribe anytime."
- Physical address in footer
- Process unsubscribes within 24 hours (faster than required)

---

### Data Processing & Storage

**Supabase (EU Hosting):**
- Data stored in `eu-west-2` (London)
- GDPR-compliant processor
- Encryption at rest and in transit

**Retention Policy:**
- **Engaged contacts:** Retain until unsubscribe
- **Unengaged contacts (0 opens, 90 days):** Suppress from future campaigns
- **Unsubscribes:** Permanent suppression list (never delete — needed for compliance)
- **Bounces:** Remove from active lists after 2 hard bounces

---

## 📈 Volume Strategy & Deliverability

### Phase 1: Domain Warming (Week 1)
**Goal:** Build sender reputation

**Approach:**
- Start with 50 emails/day
- Target highest-engagement segment (decision makers who've visited site)
- Monitor open rates, spam complaints, bounces
- Increase 20%/day if metrics healthy

**Target Metrics:**
- Open rate >15%
- Spam complaint rate <0.1%
- Bounce rate <2%

---

### Phase 2: Scale to Volume (Week 2-4)
**Goal:** Reach daily sending capacity

**Scaling Schedule:**
| Day | Emails/Day | Cumulative Sent | Segment |
|-----|------------|-----------------|---------|
| 1-3 | 50 | 150 | UK Decision Makers (engaged) |
| 4-7 | 100 | 550 | UK Decision Makers (full) |
| 8-14 | 250 | 2,300 | UK Decision Makers + Managers |
| 15-21 | 500 | 5,800 | Add US Decision Makers |
| 22-30 | 1,000 | 14,800 | Full Tier 1 + Tier 2 |
| 31+ | 2,500 | 50K+ /mo | Begin Tier 3 (volume) |

**Infrastructure:**
- **Sending Domain:** `mail.openrole.ai` (separate from main domain)
- **DKIM/SPF/DMARC:** All configured
- **Resend.com:** Transactional email provider (99.9% deliverability)
- **Warm-up tool:** Resend's warm-up feature enabled

---

### Phase 3: Multi-Domain Strategy (Month 2+)
**Goal:** Scale beyond single-domain limits

**Approach:**
- Add 2nd sending domain: `hello.openrole.ai`
- Rotate domains for different segments
- Parallel warm-up process

**Max Sending Capacity:**
- Domain 1: 2,500/day = 75K/month
- Domain 2: 2,500/day = 75K/month
- **Total:** 150K emails/month at steady state

---

## 🎨 Personalization at Scale

### Dynamic Variables
All emails use these merge tags:

```javascript
{
  firstName: "Emma",
  lastName: "Thompson",
  fullName: "Emma Thompson",
  title: "Head of People",
  companyName: "Sofology",
  industry: "Retail",  // Inferred from company
  city: "Liverpool",
  country: "UK",
  seniority: "director",  // For conditional content
  segment: "uk_decision_makers"  // For tracking
}
```

### Conditional Content Blocks

**For Executives:**
```
As {{title}}, you know that talent acquisition ROI is the #1 board-level metric for 2025.
```

**For Managers:**
```
I know you're juggling {{companySize}}+ open roles while your budget gets cut.
```

**For UK vs US:**
```
// UK
Did you know 73% of UK employers fail AI hiring visibility tests?

// US  
With 4.2M unfilled jobs in the US, AI visibility is the only moat left.
```

---

### Industry-Specific Hooks

**Retail:**
> "Retail hiring is broken. Here's how Sofology fixed it in 48 hours."

**Tech:**
> "If your eng candidates are using ChatGPT to find jobs, this matters."

**Healthcare:**
> "Nursing shortages + AI hiring = disaster. Unless you do this."

**Finance:**
> "Financial services employers are invisible to AI. Compliance won't save you."

---

## 🔗 Integration Plan: Resend + Supabase

### Resend Configuration
```javascript
// Resend API integration
const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

// Campaign send
await resend.emails.send({
  from: 'Troy Goldman <troy@mail.openrole.ai>',
  to: contact.email,
  subject: renderSubject(template, contact),
  html: renderHTML(template, contact),
  text: renderText(template, contact),
  tags: [
    { name: 'campaign_id', value: campaign.id },
    { name: 'segment', value: contact.segment },
    { name: 'seniority', value: contact.seniority }
  ],
  headers: {
    'X-Entity-Ref-ID': contact.id, // For tracking
    'List-Unsubscribe': `<https://openrole.ai/unsubscribe?id=${contact.id}>`,
    'List-Unsubscribe-Post': 'List-Unsubscribe=One-Click'
  }
});
```

### Event Tracking (Webhooks)
Resend sends webhooks for:
- ✅ `email.sent`
- ✅ `email.delivered`
- ✅ `email.opened`
- ✅ `email.clicked`
- ✅ `email.bounced`
- ✅ `email.complained` (spam report)

Our webhook handler inserts to `outreach_events`:

```javascript
// Webhook handler (frontend/api/webhooks/resend.ts)
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const payload = await request.json();
  
  // Verify webhook signature
  const signature = request.headers.get('resend-signature');
  if (!verifySignature(payload, signature)) {
    return new Response('Invalid signature', { status: 401 });
  }
  
  // Insert event
  await supabase.from('outreach_events').insert({
    contact_id: payload.data.tags.find(t => t.name === 'entity_id').value,
    campaign_id: payload.data.tags.find(t => t.name === 'campaign_id').value,
    event_type: payload.type.replace('email.', ''),
    event_data: payload.data,
    resend_email_id: payload.data.email_id,
    occurred_at: payload.created_at,
  });
  
  return new Response('OK');
}
```

This automatically updates:
- `contacts.email_opens`, `contacts.last_opened_at`
- `contacts.email_clicks`, `contacts.last_clicked_at`
- `contacts.outreach_status` → 'engaged' on click
- `outreach_campaigns.emails_opened`, etc.

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Poor Deliverability
**Mitigation:**
- Slow domain warm-up
- Monitor sender reputation daily (Postmark, Google Postmaster)
- Immediately pause if spam rate >0.2%
- Use double opt-in for re-engagement

### Risk 2: GDPR Complaints
**Mitigation:**
- Conduct Legitimate Interest Assessment (documented)
- Easy unsubscribe in every email
- Privacy policy clearly explains data use
- Respond to data requests within 72 hours

### Risk 3: Low Engagement
**Mitigation:**
- A/B test aggressively (10+ subject line variations)
- Segment hygiene (remove unengaged after 90 days)
- Re-engagement campaigns before suppression
- Offer genuine value (free audit is not bait)

### Risk 4: Resend Account Suspension
**Mitigation:**
- Stay under sending limits
- Monitor bounce/spam rates obsessively
- Have backup provider ready (SendGrid, Postmark)
- Keep suppression list synced across providers

2. **Free value first:** Audit is genuinely useful (not a lead magnet)
3. **Ruthless segmentation:** Right message, right person, right time
4. **Compliance obsession:** Trust is the product
5. **Data-driven iteration:** A/B test everything, kill what doesn't work

## 🚀 Conclusion

This database is a **£1M+ ARR asset** if executed correctly.

**The Strategy:**
1. Segment ruthlessly (18K decision makers first, not 2.5M spray-and-pray)
2. Deliver value upfront (free audit that's actually useful)
3. Scale slowly (warm up domains, build reputation)
4. Optimize obsessively (A/B test every word)
5. Stay compliant (GDPR/PECR/CAN-SPAM is not optional)

**Timeline to £50K MRR:** 3-4 months  
**Timeline to £100K MRR:** 6-8 months

The data is ready. The infrastructure is ready. The strategy is ready.

**Next step:** Troy approves, Malcolm executes.
