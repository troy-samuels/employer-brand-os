## Executive Summary

The rules of digital visibility have fundamentally changed. AI-powered search is now a dominant discovery channel, with ChatGPT processing 3B+ prompts monthly, Perplexity indexing 200B+ URLs, and Google AI Overviews appearing on ~16% of searches. The question is no longer "how do I rank?" but **"how do I get cited by AI?"**

### The 5 Most Important Findings

1. **Brand search volume (not backlinks) is the #1 predictor of LLM citations** — correlation coefficient of 0.334, the strongest measured factor (Source: Digital Bloom 7,000-citation analysis)
2. **The Princeton GEO study proves optimisation works** — specific content strategies can boost AI visibility by up to 40% (Source: KDD 2024 paper, arXiv:2311.09735)
3. **Only 11% of domains get cited by BOTH ChatGPT and Perplexity** — each platform has fundamentally different citation patterns, requiring platform-specific strategies (Source: Digital Bloom 2025 Report)
4. **Wikipedia dominates training data (~22%) and citations (~43-48% of ChatGPT conversations)** — you can't beat Wikipedia, but you can be the next source after it (Source: Profound 700K conversation analysis)
5. **llms.txt has zero measurable impact** — a Senthor study of 10M+ AI requests found 0 major bots reading it; SE Ranking's 300K-domain study confirmed no correlation with citations (Sources: Senthor, SE Ranking)

#### Training Data Hierarchy (Parametric Knowledge)

OpenAI's training data is prioritised in tiers:
- **Tier 1:** Wikipedia, licensed publisher partners (Condé Nast, Vox Media), GPTBot-accessible sites
- **Tier 2:** Reddit content with 3+ upvotes, industry publications
- **Tier 3:** YouTube transcripts, podcasts

Source: [Digital Bloom 2025 Report](https://thedigitalbloom.com/learn/2025-ai-citation-llm-visibility-report/)

#### Web Search Source Selection (When Browsing is Enabled)

- ChatGPT queries Bing and selects 3-10 diverse sources per response
- **87% of SearchGPT citations match Bing's top 10 organic results** (Seer Interactive analysis of 500+ citations)
- Only 56% correlation with Google results
- 3.2x more often ChatGPT **mentions** brands than it actually **cites** them with links
- Source: [Digital Bloom 2025 Report](https://thedigitalbloom.com/learn/2025-ai-citation-llm-visibility-report/)

#### Citation Patterns (from Profound 700K Conversation Analysis)

- **~18% of ChatGPT conversations trigger at least one web search**
- **Turn 1 is everything:** 2.5x more likely to trigger citations than Turn 10; 4x more than Turn 20
- **~6 unique citations per conversation** (trending upward Oct-Dec 2025)
- **~4 unique citations per turn** when a turn includes any citations
- **Wikipedia appears in ~1 in 6 conversations** with citations (~5% of all citations, ~18% of conversations with citations)
- **Reddit appears in ~13% of conversations** with citations
- **Top 10 domains capture only 12% of all citations** but distribution is highly unequal (Gini = 0.8)

### 1.2 Claude (Anthropic)

**Architecture:** Parametric knowledge + Brave Search integration for web retrieval

**Evidence Strength:** ⭐⭐⭐ (Less independent research available compared to ChatGPT)

#### Knowledge Retrieval

- Claude's knowledge retrieval is shaped by Anthropic's **Constitutional AI framework**, creating strong preferences for **helpful, harmless, and honest** content
- When using web search (powered by **Brave Search**), Claude autonomously determines search necessity and provides citations with URL, title, and cited_text snippets
- Claude **cross-references at least three external sources** before surfacing a claim, prioritising accuracy over recency
- Source: [Digital Bloom 2025 Report](https://thedigitalbloom.com/learn/2025-ai-citation-llm-visibility-report/); [Snezzi — How AI Chatbots Pick Sources](https://snezzi.com/blog/how-ai-chatbots-pick-sources-an-inside-look-for-2025-marketers/)

#### Source Selection Behaviour

- **Conservative approach:** May favour older, well-verified information over newer, less-confirmed data
- **Methodology-focused:** Research papers with clear methodology sections, articles citing primary sources, and content demonstrating rigorous fact-checking receive preferential treatment
- **Strict on controversial topics:** Requires additional verification steps for high-misinformation-risk subjects
- Source: [Snezzi](https://snezzi.com/blog/how-ai-chatbots-pick-sources-an-inside-look-for-2025-marketers/)

#### What's Uncertain About Claude
- Exact training data composition is not publicly documented
- How Claude weights brand mentions vs. domain authority vs. content quality is not studied at scale
- **No large-scale citation analysis exists for Claude specifically** (unlike ChatGPT and Perplexity)

---

### 1.3 Perplexity AI

**Architecture:** Real-time RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) — every query triggers real-time web search

**Evidence Strength:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Indexed architecture is well-documented; multiple studies)

#### How It Works

- Every query triggers real-time web search against a **proprietary index of 200+ billion URLs**
- Processed at tens of thousands of indexing operations per second across 400+ petabytes of storage
- Provides **5-10 inline citations per response** with numbered references
- **Real-time index refreshes** in near real-time — new content can appear within hours
- Source: [Digital Bloom 2025 Report](https://thedigitalbloom.com/learn/2025-ai-citation-llm-visibility-report/)

#### Source Selection

| Source Type | % of Top 10 Citations |
|------------|----------------------|
| Reddit | 46.7% |
| YouTube | 13.9% |
| Gartner | 7.0% |

**Key difference from ChatGPT:** Perplexity favours **structured buying guides and comparison content** over traditional news. Reddit dominates because Perplexity heavily weights community-validated information.

Source: [Digital Bloom 2025 Report](https://thedigitalbloom.com/learn/2025-ai-citation-llm-visibility-report/)

#### Media Citation Share: 8.8%
Only cites 45 media outlets total (vs ChatGPT's 82). PCMag and Forbes dominate. Strong preference for systematic product evaluations over news.

### 1.4 Google AI Overviews / Gemini

**Architecture:** Gemini LLMs + Google's existing search index and ranking signals

**Evidence Strength:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Semrush study of 10M+ keywords; Pew Research Center data)

#### How AI Overviews Work

- Generated using Google's Gemini models by gathering information from multiple web sources
- Uses **query fan-out**: running multiple related searches to compile comprehensive responses
- Evaluates content quality, source authority, and relevance as primary signals
- **93.67% of AI Overview citations link to at least one top-10 organic result**
- But only **4.5% of AI Overview URLs directly matched a Page 1 organic URL** — Google draws from deeper pages on authoritative domains
- Average: **10.2 links from 4 unique domains per AI Overview response**
- Source: [Digital Bloom 2025 Report](https://thedigitalbloom.com/learn/2025-ai-citation-llm-visibility-report/); [Semrush AI Overviews Study](https://www.semrush.com/blog/semrush-ai-overviews-study/)

#### AI Overview Prevalence

- Started at 6.49% of queries (Jan 2025), peaked at 24.61% (Jul 2025), settled at 15.69% (Nov 2025)
- 50%+ of searches show AI Overviews (up from 18% in March 2025) in some contexts
- Expanding beyond informational: Commercial queries up from 8% to 19%; Transactional up from 2% to 14%
- Source: [Semrush AI Overviews Study](https://www.semrush.com/blog/semrush-ai-overviews-study/)

#### Click Behaviour Impact

- Users click traditional search result links **8% of the time** when AI Overview present (vs 15% without)
- Users click results **within** the AI Overview only **1% of the time**
- Users more likely to **end browsing session entirely** (26% vs 16%)
- Most frequently cited sources in AI summaries: Wikipedia, YouTube, Reddit (15% collectively)
- Government websites (.gov) more common in AI summaries (6%) than standard results (2%)
- Source: [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/22/google-users-are-less-likely-to-click-on-links-when-an-ai-summary-appears-in-the-results/) (Jul 2025)

#### Media Citation Share: 7.6% (AI Overviews) / 5.7% (Gemini)
- AI Overviews: Most diversified citation base (96 outlets) but each gets small share. Tolerates older, evergreen content.
- Gemini: Lowest media citation share (5.7%). Only 35 media outlets cited. Forbes alone = 23% of all Gemini media citations. Strongly favours direct sources, product documentation, and structured data.

## Section 2: Proven Citation/Recommendation Factors

### 2.1 Brand Search Volume
**Impact: 🔴 CRITICAL (Strongest measured factor)**

- **Correlation coefficient of 0.334 with AI visibility** — the strongest predictor found in any study
- Sites mentioned on **4+ platforms are 2.8x more likely** to appear in ChatGPT responses
- This means: if people search for your brand by name on Google, you're more likely to be cited by AI

**Evidence strength:** Proven by study (7,000+ citations across 1,600 URLs)
**Platforms affected:** All
**Source:** [Digital Bloom 2025 Report](https://thedigitalbloom.com/learn/2025-ai-citation-llm-visibility-report/)

### 2.2 Content Quality & Citation Methodology (GEO Strategies)
**Impact: 🔴 CRITICAL**

The Princeton GEO study (10,000 queries, 9 sources) proved specific optimisation methods work:

| Method | Visibility Impact | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|-------|
| **Cite Sources Method** | **+115.1%** (for rank #5 sites) | Adding references and citations to your content |
| **Quotation Addition** | **+37%** | Adding expert quotes (especially effective on Perplexity) |
| **Statistics Addition** | **+22%** | Including specific numbers and data points |
| **Fluency Optimisation** | **+15-30%** | Improving readability and flow |
| **Keyword Stuffing** | **NEGATIVE impact** | Actively harmful |

**Critical insight:** Lower-ranked traditional SERP sites benefit *significantly more* from GEO optimisation than top-ranked sites — making this a powerful challenger strategy.

**Evidence strength:** Proven by peer-reviewed academic study (KDD 2024)
**Platforms affected:** All (tested across multiple generative engines)
**Source:** [Princeton GEO Paper — arXiv:2311.09735](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735)

### 2.3 Content Structure & Format
**Impact: 🔴 CRITICAL**

#### High-Citation Content Formats (from 30M+ citations):

| Format | % of AI Citations |
|--------|------------------|
| **Comparative Listicles** | **32.5%** (HIGHEST) |
| Opinion Blogs | 9.91% |
| Product/Service Descriptions | 4.73% |
| FAQ/Q&A Formats | High (especially Perplexity/Gemini) |
| How-to Guides | Strong performer |

**Optimal paragraph length:** 40-60 words for easy AI extraction and chunking

**Answer-first structures and scannable subheadings increase selection odds by up to 39%**

**Evidence strength:** Proven by multiple industry studies
**Platforms affected:** All
**Sources:** [Digital Bloom](https://thedigitalbloom.com/learn/2025-ai-citation-llm-visibility-report/); [Snezzi](https://snezzi.com/blog/how-ai-chatbots-pick-sources-an-inside-look-for-2025-marketers/)

### 2.4 Structured Data (Schema.org / JSON-LD)
**Impact: 🟠 HIGH**

A Search Engine Land experiment tested three identical single-page sites differing only in schema quality:

| Schema Quality | Google Rank | AI Overview |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| Well-implemented | Position 3 | YES — Appeared |
| Poorly implemented | Position 8 | No appearance |
| No schema | NOT INDEXED | N/A |

- **47% higher AI citation rates** for comparison tables using proper `<thead>` and descriptive columns
- Sites with clear schema markup and fast mobile performance see **47% higher likelihood of being cited** by AI chatbots
- Wikidata is the #1 source for Google's Knowledge Graph (500B facts, 5B entities)
- **sameAs property linking to Wikidata increases entity recognition**

**Priority Schema Types:**
- Tier 1 (Essential): HowTo, Article/BlogPosting, Organization, Person
- Tier 2 (High Value): Product/Offer, LocalBusiness, Review/AggregateRating, Speakable

**Evidence strength:** Proven by controlled experiment (Search Engine Land); corroborated by industry data
**Platforms affected:** Primarily Google AI Overviews and Gemini; moderate effect on ChatGPT/Perplexity
**Sources:** [Digital Bloom](https://thedigitalbloom.com/learn/2025-ai-citation-llm-visibility-report/); [Snezzi](https://snezzi.com/blog/how-ai-chatbots-pick-sources-an-inside-look-for-2025-marketers/)

### 2.5 E-E-A-T Signals (Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)
**Impact: 🟠 HIGH**

AI models assess E-E-A-T through:
- **Author credentials and institutional affiliations** — content by recognised experts gets preferential treatment
- **Transparent methodology** — explaining how products were tested or research was conducted
- **Citation chains** — sites that cite their own sources perform better
- **Publication dates and update timestamps** — freshness signals
- **Claude specifically:** Constitutional AI framework creates strong preferences for helpful, harmless, honest content

**Evidence strength:** Industry consensus, supported by multiple observational studies
**Platforms affected:** All (especially Claude and Google)
**Sources:** [Outpace SEO](https://outpaceseo.com/article/how-generative-ai-cites-sources/); [Skyscale](https://skyscale.com.au/blogs/how-chatgpt-selects-sources); [Snezzi](https://snezzi.com/blog/how-ai-chatbots-pick-sources-an-inside-look-for-2025-marketers/)

### 2.6 Domain Authority
**Impact: 🟡 MODERATE (but nuanced)**

- **73% of enterprise AI deployments reference domain authority metrics** when ranking external information sources
- **61% of chatbot-attributed links go to sites with 100+ referring domains**
- **Light preference for ChatGPT** in particular; weaker signal for Perplexity
- However, the Princeton GEO study found that **traditional backlinks show weak or neutral correlation** with AI citations — contradicting traditional SEO wisdom

**The nuance:** Domain authority matters as a baseline, but content quality and brand recognition matter more. A high-DA site with poor content will lose to a low-DA site with excellent, well-structured content.

**Evidence strength:** Mixed — some studies show correlation; others show it's less important than expected
**Platforms affected:** Moderate across all; strongest for Google AI Overviews
**Sources:** [Digital Bloom](https://thedigitalbloom.com/learn/2025-ai-citation-llm-visibility-report/); [Snezzi](https://snezzi.com/blog/how-ai-chatbots-pick-sources-an-inside-look-for-2025-marketers/)

### 2.7 Content Freshness
**Impact: 🟠 HIGH**

- **65% of AI bot hits target content published within the past year**
- **79% from content updated within 2 years**
- **Only 6% from content older than 6 years**
- Pages updated within **6-18 months** are weighted most highly
- For trending topics, ChatGPT may apply strict recency filters (past week or days only)
- However, authority wins for evergreen topics — a definitive 2023 guide can outrank a thin 2025 post

**Evidence strength:** Proven by study (300,000+ keywords and 5,000+ URLs)
**Platforms affected:** All (especially Perplexity due to real-time indexing)
**Sources:** [Digital Bloom](https://thedigitalbloom.com/learn/2025-ai-citation-llm-visibility-report/); [Wellows](https://wellows.com/insights/chatgpt-citations-report/)

### 2.8 Topical Authority / Comprehensive Coverage
**Impact: 🟠 HIGH**

- AI systems pay attention to websites that present **expert information about specific areas** rather than mentioning topics briefly
- Comprehensive guides earn more citations than short posts
- **Topic clusters** (pillar page + supporting articles) help AI understand content relationships
- An article with **10,000+ words and Flesch Score 55 received 187 total citations** (72 from ChatGPT), while similar content under 4,000 words with lower readability received only 3 citations

**Evidence strength:** Proven by study (Digital Bloom citation analysis)
**Platforms affected:** All
**Sources:** [Outpace SEO](https://outpaceseo.com/article/how-generative-ai-cites-sources/); [Digital Bloom](https://thedigitalbloom.com/learn/2025-ai-citation-llm-visibility-report/)

### 2.9 Direct Answers / Answer-First Structure
**Impact: 🟠 HIGH**

- Lead with the answer: "The best X is Y" not "Y might be good"
- Answer the question immediately, then provide supporting details
- FAQ sections that address common related questions are particularly effective
- **39% increase in selection odds** with answer-first structures and scannable subheadings
- ChatGPT rewrites queries into targeted search terms — pages matching these rewritten queries get selected

**Evidence strength:** Industry consensus, supported by the Princeton GEO study
**Platforms affected:** All
**Sources:** [Snezzi](https://snezzi.com/blog/how-ai-chatbots-pick-sources-an-inside-look-for-2025-marketers/); [Digital Bloom](https://thedigitalbloom.com/learn/2025-ai-citation-llm-visibility-report/)

### 2.10 Wikipedia Presence
**Impact: 🟡 MODERATE-HIGH**

- Wikipedia content represents **~22% of major LLM training data**
- Wikipedia is the #1 cited source by ChatGPT (~43-48% of conversations with citations)
- Most frequently cited source in both Google AI summaries AND standard search results
- **Having a Wikipedia page** likely increases your presence in training data and thus parametric knowledge
- **Wikidata** serves as the #1 source for Google's Knowledge Graph (500B facts, 5B entities)

**Evidence strength:** Strong statistical evidence from multiple studies; mechanism well-understood
**Platforms affected:** All (especially ChatGPT and Google)
**Sources:** [Profound](https://www.tryprofound.com/blog/chatgpt-citation-sources); [Digital Bloom](https://thedigitalbloom.com/learn/2025-ai-citation-llm-visibility-report/); [Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/22/google-users-are-less-likely-to-click-on-links-when-an-ai-summary-appears-in-the-results/)

### 2.11 Reddit Mentions
**Impact: 🟡 MODERATE-HIGH**

- Reddit is the **#2 most-cited source by ChatGPT** (12-13% of conversations)
- **#1 most-cited source by Perplexity** (46.7% of top 10 citations)
- Reddit content with **3+ upvotes** gets into OpenAI's Tier 2 training data
- Reddit also commonly cited in Google AI Overviews
- Discussion and forum blocks appear on 90%+ of SERPs with AI Overviews

**Evidence strength:** Proven by multiple large-scale studies
**Platforms affected:** All (especially Perplexity and ChatGPT)
**Sources:** [Profound](https://www.tryprofound.com/blog/chatgpt-citation-sources); [Digital Bloom](https://thedigitalbloom.com/learn/2025-ai-citation-llm-visibility-report/)

### 2.12 AI Crawler Access (robots.txt)
**Impact: 🟡 MODERATE**

- **GPTBot traffic grew 305%** from May 2024-2025
- 312 of top 10,000 domains block GPTBot entirely; 546 have explicit AI bot rules
- **Strategic approach:** Allow search-focused bots (OAI-SearchBot, PerplexityBot) while optionally blocking training-only bots (GPTBot)
- Different bots for different purposes:
  - GPTBot = model training
  - OAI-SearchBot = real-time search results
  - Google-Extended = Gemini training
  - ClaudeBot = Claude training
  - PerplexityBot = real-time search

**Evidence strength:** Technical documentation from platforms; traffic analysis data
**Platforms affected:** All
**Source:** [Digital Bloom](https://thedigitalbloom.com/learn/2025-ai-citation-llm-visibility-report/)

**Recommended robots.txt for maximum AI visibility:**
```
User-agent: OAI-SearchBot
Allow: /

User-agent: PerplexityBot
Allow: /

User-agent: ClaudeBot
Allow: /

User-agent: GPTBot
Disallow: / # Optional: block training but allow search

User-agent: Google-Extended
Allow: / # or Disallow if you don't want to train Gemini
```

### 2.13 llms.txt
**Impact: ⚪ NONE (Currently)**

**This is one of the most over-hyped "factors" in AI SEO. The evidence is clear: it doesn't work.**

- **Senthor study: 10M+ certified AI requests, 0 reads by major bots.** 104 total requests came from curious humans and small unidentified scrapers — not OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic.
- **SE Ranking study: 300,000 domains analysed.** No correlation between llms.txt presence and AI citation frequency. Removing llms.txt from their XGBoost model actually **improved** accuracy — it was adding noise.
- **OtterlyAI 90-day experiment:** Zero measurable effect on AI visibility.
- Only ~10% of websites have an llms.txt file
- No major AI platform has officially adopted llms.txt as a standard
- Google explicitly states AI Overviews rely on traditional SEO signals, not llms.txt

**Evidence strength:** Definitively disproven by multiple independent studies
**Platforms affected:** None
**Sources:** [Senthor — 10M AI Requests Study](https://www.senthor.io/en/blog/data-study-llms-txt-vs-reality) (Jan 2026); [SE Ranking — 300K Domains Study](https://seranking.com/blog/llms-txt/) (Nov 2025)

### 2.14 Backlink Profile
**Impact: 🟡 MODERATE (Weaker than expected)**

- Digital Bloom's analysis found backlinks show **"weak or neutral" correlation** with AI citations — contradicting traditional SEO
- 61% of chatbot-attributed links go to sites with 100+ referring domains (but this may be correlation, not causation — authoritative sites naturally have more backlinks)
- **Backlinks matter more for Google AI Overviews** (which strongly correlate with organic rankings) than for ChatGPT or Perplexity
- **Brand mentions may matter more than backlinks** for AI visibility specifically

**Evidence strength:** Mixed signals — traditional correlation exists but weaker than expected
**Platforms affected:** Primarily Google AI Overviews; weak for ChatGPT/Perplexity
**Sources:** [Digital Bloom](https://thedigitalbloom.com/learn/2025-ai-citation-llm-visibility-report/); [Snezzi](https://snezzi.com/blog/how-ai-chatbots-pick-sources-an-inside-look-for-2025-marketers/)

### 2.15 Page Speed / Technical SEO
**Impact: 🟢 LOW-MODERATE**

- Fast page load times favour AI crawler access (crawlers prefer performant sites)
- Mobile-first optimisation matters (majority of AI Overview citations from mobile-indexed pages)
- Clean HTML with semantic headings matters — ChatGPT processes content with clear headers more effectively
- Heavy JavaScript and modal overlays can **prevent** citation
- **Multi-modal content (images, videos) did NOT move the needle** for AI citations specifically

**Evidence strength:** Reasonable inference from technical documentation; limited direct studies
**Platforms affected:** Primarily Google AI Overviews

## Section 4: Platform-Specific Optimisation Playbooks

### 4.1 How to Get Cited by ChatGPT

**Confidence level:** HIGH — extensive research data available

#### Must-Do Actions

1. **Ensure Bing indexation** — 87% of ChatGPT web citations come from Bing's top 10. If you're not indexed in Bing, you're invisible to ChatGPT Search.
   - Submit your sitemap to [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/)
   - Implement IndexNow for instant indexing

2. **Build brand search volume** — The #1 predictor (0.334 correlation). Invest in brand awareness through PR, content marketing, and cross-platform presence.

3. **Get mentioned on 4+ platforms** — Sites on 4+ platforms are 2.8x more likely to appear. Ensure presence on your website + Wikipedia/Wikidata + Reddit + industry publications + review sites.

4. **Win the "first question"** — Turn 1 conversations capture most citations. Optimise for queries that START research journeys: "what is X", "how does Y work", "best Z for [use case]".

5. **Be the source AFTER Wikipedia** — Don't try to out-Wikipedia Wikipedia. Be the next step: deeper analysis, current data, expert opinion it can't provide.

6. **Add citations, statistics, and expert quotes to your content** — The Princeton GEO study proves these boost visibility by 22-115%.

7. **Structure content for RAG extraction:**
   - Lead with direct answers (first paragraph answers the query)
   - Use clear H2/H3 heading hierarchy matching likely search queries
   - Optimal paragraph length: 40-60 words
   - Self-contained sections that work as standalone chunks
   - Include verifiable data points

8. **Create comparative listicles** — 32.5% of all AI citations come from this format. "Best X for Y", "Top 10 Z", comparison tables.

9. **Allow AI crawlers** in robots.txt:
   ```
   User-agent: OAI-SearchBot
   Allow: /
   ```

10. **Know your citation neighbours** — ChatGPT cites competitors side-by-side. Ensure your content accounts for what competitors are saying.

#### Don't Bother With
- llms.txt (zero impact proven)
- Keyword stuffing (negative impact proven)
- Trying to be cited alone — ChatGPT cites 4-6 sources per turn

---

### 4.2 How to Get Cited by Claude

**Confidence level:** MODERATE — less independent research available

#### What's Known

**Confidence level:** HIGH — architecture is well-understood; real-time retrieval makes it more actionable

#### Must-Do Actions

1. **Optimise for real-time discovery** — Perplexity indexes in near real-time. Fresh, regularly updated content can appear within hours.

2. **Reddit is king for Perplexity** — 46.7% of top citations come from Reddit. Having genuine, upvoted Reddit discussions about your brand/product is massive.

3. **Create structured buying guides and comparison content** — This is what Perplexity rewards most. Systematic product evaluations over news.

4. **Add expert quotations** — The Princeton GEO study found +37% improvement specifically on Perplexity from adding quotes.

5. **Use Q&A format** — Perplexity provides 5-10 inline citations per response. FAQ-style content with clear question-answer pairs performs well.

6. **Build long-form, comprehensive content** — Perplexity correlates with higher word counts more than other platforms.

7. **Allow PerplexityBot** in robots.txt:
   ```
   User-agent: PerplexityBot
   Allow: /
   ```

8. **Target niche queries** — Perplexity's broad index means niche expertise can compete effectively against general authority.

---

### 4.4 How to Get Cited by Google AI Overviews

**Confidence level:** VERY HIGH — most-researched platform with Semrush 10M+ keyword study

#### Must-Do Actions

1. **Traditional SEO still matters most** — 93.67% of AI Overview citations link to top-10 organic results. Google says: "Apply the same foundational SEO best practices."

2. **Target long-tail keywords** — Longer, more specific queries trigger AI Overviews more. 53% of 10+ word searches generate AI summaries vs. 8% for 1-2 word searches.

3. **Implement schema markup properly** — The Search Engine Land experiment showed well-implemented schema = Position 3 + AI Overview appearance; no schema = not indexed at all.

4. **Create content that answers questions** — 60% of question-word searches generate AI summaries. Structure content around "who/what/when/why/how" questions.

5. **Build brand mentions and backlinks** — Google AI Overviews heavily weight traditional ranking signals, including brand authority.

6. **Optimise for mobile** — Majority of AI Overview citations come from mobile-indexed pages.

7. **Create comparison tables** — 47% higher citation rates with proper HTML tables.

8. **Maintain presence on YouTube and Reddit** — Video carousels and discussion blocks appear alongside most AI Overviews.

9. **Ensure crawlability and indexability** — Fix robots.txt blocks, noindex tags, 4XX errors, and poor site structure.

10. **Create content for deeper pages** — Only 4.5% of AI Overview URLs match Page 1 organic URLs directly. Google pulls from deeper pages on authoritative domains.

---

### 4.5 How to Get Cited by Microsoft Copilot

**Confidence level:** MODERATE — tied to Bing; less independent research

#### Must-Do Actions

1. **Optimise for Bing** — Copilot uses Bing grounding for consumer queries. Everything that works for Bing SEO works for Copilot.

2. **Implement IndexNow** — Critical for Copilot. Enables instant content indexing notification. This is the single most impactful technical action for Copilot visibility.

3. **Submit to Bing Webmaster Tools** — Ensure your site is fully indexed.

4. **Create forward-looking technology content** — Copilot's media citation pattern leans toward technology trend analysis and forward-looking industry coverage.

5. **Copilot has the second-highest media citation share (18.7%)** — Getting featured in technology publications provides outsized Copilot visibility.

## Section 5: Employer Brand Specific Citation Factors

### 5.1 What Makes AI Recommend One Employer Over Another?

Based on the general citation factors above, applied specifically to employer brand content:

#### Factor 1: Brand Search Volume (Critical)
- If job seekers are actively searching for "[Company Name] jobs" or "[Company Name] reviews", this directly increases AI citation probability
- **Actionable:** Invest in employer brand awareness campaigns that drive branded searches
- Companies with strong consumer brands have a built-in advantage
- **Evidence strength:** Proven (0.334 correlation applies to all domains including employer brands)

#### Factor 2: Multi-Platform Presence (Critical)
- Companies mentioned on 4+ platforms are 2.8x more likely to appear
- For employer brands, this means: Company website careers page + Glassdoor + LinkedIn + Indeed + Reddit (r/cscareerquestions, r/jobs, etc.) + Industry publications
- **Gap opportunity:** Most companies have careers pages and Glassdoor profiles but lack Reddit presence and Wikipedia coverage

#### Factor 3: Comparative Listicle Presence (High Impact)
- 32.5% of AI citations come from comparative listicles
- Getting included in "Best Companies to Work For", "Top Employers in [Industry]", "Best Places for Remote Work" type articles is extremely high-value
- These articles serve as the employer brand equivalent of product comparison content
- **Actionable:** Pursue media placements in comparison/ranking articles

#### Factor 4: Glassdoor/Indeed and the Data Gap
- **Critical insight:** Glassdoor and Indeed have **restricted AI crawler access** for much of their content
- This creates a significant **information vacuum** for AI models about employer reputation
- When AI models can't access Glassdoor reviews, they rely more heavily on:
  - The employer's own careers content
  - Reddit discussions about working at the company
  - News articles about company culture
  - LinkedIn company page information
- **Strategic opportunity:** Fill the gap that Glassdoor blocking creates by publishing comprehensive employer information on your own domain

#### Factor 5: Structured Careers Content
- Schema markup matters significantly for AI citation
- Implement `Organization`, `JobPosting`, `EmployerAggregateRating` schema
- Create structured salary data pages with proper `<table>` HTML
- FAQ schema addressing common candidate questions: "What is it like to work at [Company]?", "What is the average salary at [Company]?", "Does [Company] offer remote work?"

### 5.2 How Salary Pages Affect AI Citations

- Salary transparency pages with structured data are highly citable by AI
- AI models answering "What does [Company] pay for [Role]?" will look for:
  - Structured salary range data on the employer's own website
  - Comparison tables (47% higher citation rate)
  - Clear, machine-readable formats
- If your salary data is only on Glassdoor/Indeed (which may be blocked from AI crawlers), the AI may hallucinate or use outdated information
- **Actionable:** Publish salary ranges on your careers domain with proper schema markup

### 5.3 How llms.txt Files Affect Employer Citations

**They don't.** As proven by the Senthor (10M requests, 0 reads) and SE Ranking (300K domains, no correlation) studies, llms.txt has zero measurable impact on AI citations. This applies equally to employer brand content.

However, there is a **different strategic value** for employer brands: creating an `llms.txt`-style structured summary of your employer value proposition could be useful as a **template for future AI integration** if the standard ever gains traction. Low effort, no current benefit, minimal downside.

### 5.4 Which Employer Content Formats Get Cited Most?

Based on general citation format data applied to employer context:

| Format | AI Citation Potential | Rationale |
|--------|----------------------|-----------|
| "Best Companies" comparison listicles | VERY HIGH (32.5%) | #1 cited format overall |
| FAQ/Q&A about working at company | HIGH | Matches AI question-answering patterns |
| Salary comparison tables | HIGH | Structured, factual, machine-readable |
| Day-in-the-life/culture articles | MODERATE | Provides context AI can't get elsewhere |
| Employee testimonial quotes | MODERATE | Expert quotation strategy (+37% GEO) |
| Benefits summary pages | MODERATE | Factual, structured, commonly queried |
| Generic "we're a great place to work" pages | LOW | Too promotional, no unique data |
| Video-only content | LOW | Multi-modal content didn't move the needle |

### 5.5 Company Size/Fame and AI Citation

- **Large, well-known companies have a massive built-in advantage** due to:
  - Higher brand search volume (the #1 factor)
  - More Wikipedia coverage
  - More Reddit discussions
  - More media mentions
  - Stronger training data representation (parametric knowledge)
- **Smaller companies can compete through:**
  - Niche authority: 52% of ChatGPT citations go to 38,000+ long-tail domains
  - Comprehensive, structured content with statistics and citations
  - GEO optimisation methods (which benefit lower-ranked sites MORE)
  - Reddit community engagement
  - Getting included in industry "best employer" comparison articles

### 5.6 The Information Vacuum Opportunity

**Key strategic insight for BrandOS:**

There is a growing **information vacuum** about employer quality and culture in AI responses because:

1. **Glassdoor/Indeed restrict AI crawlers** → less employee review data available to AI
2. **Most employers have thin careers content** → few structured, citable pages about culture, salaries, benefits
3. **AI models default to Wikipedia + Reddit + news** when employer-specific data is thin
4. **No standard exists** for employer information exchange with AI (llms.txt doesn't work)

**This creates a massive opportunity** for employers who:
- Publish comprehensive, structured employer information on their own domain
- Use proper schema markup for job postings and organisation data
- Create FAQ content answering specific candidate questions
- Generate Reddit-worthy employer brand content
- Get included in industry comparison articles

**BrandOS can be the platform that fills this gap systematically.**

## Methodology Notes

This research was conducted on 19 February 2026 using:
- Browser-based Google Search for source discovery
- Direct URL fetching of identified articles and studies
- Cross-referencing of claims across multiple independent sources
- Prioritisation of studies with clear methodology documentation and large datasets

### Evidence Classification System Used

| Rating | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Proven by study | Peer-reviewed academic paper or controlled experiment with clear methodology |
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Proven by study | Large-scale industry study (1,000+ data points) with published methodology |
| ⭐⭐⭐ Industry consensus | Multiple authoritative sources agree; mechanism is plausible |
| ⭐⭐ Correlational | Data shows correlation but causation not established |
| ⭐ Unproven | Reasonable inference or anecdotal; limited evidence |

### Limitations

- Most studies focus on English-language, US-centric queries. International patterns may differ.
- AI systems are rapidly evolving. Findings from Q4 2025 may not fully apply by Q3 2026.
- Some sources (Snezzi, Relixir) are from companies selling AI SEO services, creating potential bias toward overstating optimisation impact.
- ChatGPT's citation behaviour varies per conversation — no study can capture all patterns.
- Claude-specific research is notably thin compared to ChatGPT and Google AI Overviews.
