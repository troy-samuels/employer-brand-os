# UK Job Sites Traffic Comparison Report

**Date:** February 7, 2026
**Author:** Manus AI

## Executive Summary

This report provides a detailed traffic and market comparison of four leading UK job websites: **totaljobs.com**, **glassdoor.co.uk**, **reed.co.uk**, and the UK operations of **indeed.com**. The analysis is based on publicly available data from December 2025, primarily sourced from SEMrush and other market analytics platforms. 

The UK online recruitment market is dominated by a few key players, with Totaljobs emerging as the leader in direct UK traffic. Indeed.com, while a global powerhouse, holds a strong secondary position in the UK. A significant trend across the board is the growing influence of mobile traffic and the nascent but important emergence of referral traffic from AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT. Reed.co.uk has taken a particularly proactive stance in this area, launching a dedicated AI platform, Reed.ai, and implementing technical measures like `llms.txt` to welcome AI crawlers, a strategy that is still in its early stages but indicates a clear forward-looking approach.

## 1. UK Market Landscape & Rankings (December 2025)

The UK job board market is highly competitive. Based on the most recent data, Totaljobs.com holds the top position for monthly visits within the UK's Recruitment & Staffing category, closely followed by government services and then other major commercial players. Indeed.com's global platform remains a dominant force, with the UK being its second-largest market.

A comparison of the top UK-focused job sites reveals the following hierarchy based on monthly traffic:

| Rank | Domain | Monthly Visits | Desktop Share | Mobile Share | MoM Change | YoY Change | Main Traffic Source |
|:----:|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
| 1 | totaljobs.com | 6.49M | 23.91% | 76.09% | ▲ 8.68% | ▲ 1.13% | Direct |
| 2 | glassdoor.co.uk | 4.6M | 36.87% | 63.13% | ▼ 9.75% | ▲ 4.14% | Direct |
| 3 | reed.co.uk | 2.9M | 32.09% | 67.91% | ▲ 0.69% | ▼ 26.21% | Direct |

Notably, **reed.co.uk** experienced a significant **26.21% year-over-year decline** in traffic, the most substantial drop among the top competitors. In contrast, **totaljobs.com** shows healthy month-over-month growth. All platforms are heavily reliant on mobile users, with mobile traffic constituting between 63% and 76% of their total visits.

## 2. Individual Site Analysis

### 2.1 Totaljobs.com

As the UK market leader, Totaljobs.com recorded **7.12 million visits** in December 2025, showing an impressive **8.12% increase** from the previous month [2]. The platform is heavily mobile-focused, with **74.43% of its users accessing via mobile devices**. While direct traffic is its primary source (44.67%), the site has significantly increased its investment in paid search, which grew by **135.92%** month-over-month. This aggressive paid strategy, coupled with a massive **77.55% increase in backlinks** in December, suggests a strong push for market consolidation and growth.

### 2.2 Glassdoor.co.uk

Glassdoor.co.uk holds a strong position with **5.79 million monthly visits** [3]. Unlike its competitors who saw paid traffic growth, Glassdoor registered no paid search traffic in December 2025. Its traffic is primarily driven by organic search (47.32%) and direct visits (30.64%). The site experienced a slight downturn, with an **8.98% decrease in month-over-month traffic** and a 13.83% drop in organic search traffic. This could indicate a higher reliance on its established brand and content (company reviews, salary data) rather than paid acquisition.

### 2.3 Reed.co.uk

Reed.co.uk attracted **3.42 million visits** in December 2025, showing a slight month-over-month decrease of 0.12% [4]. The most concerning metric is the steep **26.21% year-over-year decline** in traffic [1]. While organic traffic dropped by 1.82%, the company made a significant investment in paid search, which increased by **112.16%**. This suggests a strategic shift to offset organic losses. Reed maintains a strong brand, with direct traffic accounting for 54.26% of its visits.

### 2.4 Indeed (UK Operations)

Indeed operates on a global scale, making direct comparison complex. Its global platform attracted **360.7 million visits** in December 2025, with the UK being its second-largest market after the US [5]. Indeed's UK presence is substantial, consistently ranking as a top job site. The platform's authority is unmatched, with a maximum Authority Score of 100. Like its competitors, Indeed saw a surge in paid search traffic (up 233.79% globally) while organic traffic saw a slight decline.

## 3. The Rise of AI-Driven Referral Traffic

A new and important trend is the growth of referral traffic from AI chatbots and Large Language Models (LLMs). While still a small fraction of overall traffic, it represents a new frontier for user acquisition. All four platforms are seeing traffic from these sources.

| Domain | ChatGPT Visits | Perplexity Visits | Other AI Sources |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|
| **Indeed.com (Global)** | 882,000 | 73,000 | jobright.ai (227k) |
| **Glassdoor.co.uk** | 21,000 | 953 | Gemini (596) |
| **Totaljobs.com** | 16,000 | 1,000 | Claude (442) |
| **Reed.co.uk** | 14,000 | 981 | Copilot (451) |

Indeed's global scale gives it a clear advantage in capturing AI-driven traffic. However, the presence of this traffic across all major UK boards indicates that users are increasingly turning to AI assistants for job discovery. This trend is expected to grow as AI models become more integrated into daily workflows.

## 4. Reed's Proactive AI Strategy: Reed.ai and llms.txt

Reed has distinguished itself with a forward-thinking and transparent AI strategy. This is most evident in two key initiatives: the launch of **Reed.ai** and the implementation of an **`llms.txt`** file.

### 4.1 Reed.ai Platform

Launched as a separate but connected entity, Reed.ai is an AI-powered recruitment agent designed to connect employers with candidates more efficiently [6]. In an interview, CEO James Reed acknowledged the platform was still in its early stages, stating, "It doesn’t work very well," but emphasized the company's commitment to iterating and improving it, drawing parallels to the early days of the internet in 1995 [7]. The platform aims to surface 
passive candidates and will not be used to automatically reject applicants, keeping the final decision in human hands.

### 4.2 Welcoming AI with `llms.txt` and `robots.txt`

In a move to embrace the AI-driven future of the web, Reed.co.uk has implemented both a `robots.txt` file that explicitly allows major AI crawlers and a more detailed `llms.txt` file. 

> The `robots.txt` file on reed.co.uk contains the following directives:
> 
> ```
> # Explicit Allow Rules for Major AI and LLM Crawlers
> # OpenAI bots
> User-agent: OAI-SearchBot
> User-agent: ChatGPT-User
> User-agent: GPTBot
> Allow: /
> 
> # Anthropic (Claude)
> User-agent: AnthropicBot
> Allow: /
> 
> #Perplexity AI
> User-agent: PerplexityBot
> Allow: /
> ```
> *Source: reed.co.uk/robots.txt [8]*

This proactive stance is further detailed in their `llms.txt` file, a new standard for providing guidance to AI models [9]. This file, last updated in November 2025, outlines the site's structure, key content areas, and explicitly points to the Reed.ai platform. This strategy positions Reed to be a valuable and well-understood source for the next generation of search and information discovery tools, potentially giving it a long-term advantage as AI integration deepens.

## 5. Conclusion and Future Outlook

The UK job site market is in a dynamic phase. While Totaljobs.com currently leads in direct UK traffic and is growing, the global dominance of Indeed cannot be understated. Glassdoor maintains a strong niche with its focus on employer branding and reviews, while Reed, despite a significant year-over-year traffic decline, is making bold, strategic moves into the AI space that could reshape its future.

The key trends to watch are:

*   **The battle for market share:** Totaljobs' aggressive growth strategy versus the established dominance of Indeed.
*   **The impact of AI:** The growth of AI-driven referral traffic and the success of platforms like Reed.ai will be critical.
*   **Adapting to market conditions:** The decline in graduate roles and the cooling labor market will test the resilience and adaptability of all players.

Reed's proactive AI strategy, while still in its infancy and facing internal skepticism about its current effectiveness, is a significant differentiator. By openly welcoming AI crawlers and building a dedicated AI platform, Reed is betting on a future where job discovery is increasingly mediated by intelligent agents. The success of this strategy will be a key factor in its ability to reverse its current traffic decline and reclaim market leadership in the years to come.
