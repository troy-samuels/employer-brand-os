- **Email:** firstname.lastname@synthesia.io (standard format)

**Personalised Hook:**  
"You're one of the UK's fastest-growing AI companies with 400+ team members and backed by Accel. But when I search 'best AI companies to work for UK', your careers story doesn't surface in Claude or ChatGPT results. Our audit would show you exactly what AI sees about your employer brand - and what's missing that could help you win top AI talent in a competitive market."

---

### 2. Beamery

**Domain:** beamery.com  
**Industry:** HR Tech / Talent Operating System

- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/company/beamery/people/
- **Email:** firstname.lastname@beamery.com

**Personalised Hook:**

We'll show you exactly what candidates see when they ask ChatGPT about working at Beamery, so you can fix the narrative gap."

---

### 3. Onfido

**Domain:** onfido.com  
**Industry:** Identity Verification / SaaS

- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/company/onfido/people/
- **Email:** firstname.lastname@onfido.com

**Personalised Hook:**  
"Onfido verifies millions of identities globally, but your employer identity in AI search is unclear. You're scaling across 5 continents with 400+ people - yet when candidates ask AI about 'best identity verification companies to work for', you're barely mentioned. Our audit shows where you rank vs. competitors in AI-powered hiring research."

---

### 4. Paddle

**Domain:** paddle.com  
**Industry:** SaaS Billing Platform  
**Headcount:** ~300  
**HQ:** London (+ global remote)

- **Name:** TBC
- **Title:** Head of Talent
- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/company/paddle/people/
- **Email:** firstname.lastname@paddle.com

**Personalised Hook:**  
"Paddle's product is tech-first and developer-loved. But your careers page lacks technical depth - no engineering blog mentions, no stack details, minimal culture content. When engineers ask AI about working at Paddle, they get generic answers. We'll show you what's missing to attract senior eng talent in a crowded fintech market."

---

### 5. GoCardless

**Domain:** gocardless.com  
**Industry:** Fintech / Payments  
**Headcount:** ~450  
**HQ:** London (global offices)  
**Careers Page:** https://gocardless.com/about/careers  
**Live Roles:** 10+ (Engineering, Product, Commercial)  
**Glassdoor Rating:** 3.7/5 (145 reviews)

**Key Decision Maker:**
- **Name:** TBC
- **Title:** Talent Director / Head of People
- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/company/gocardless/people/
- **Email:** firstname.lastname@gocardless.com

**Personalised Hook:**  
"GoCardless has great brand recognition in payments, but AI doesn't surface your employer story. Glassdoor mentions 'work-life balance concerns' from 2023 - and that's what ChatGPT references when asked about your culture. You've made improvements since then, but AI doesn't know it. Our audit shows the gap between reality and AI perception."

---

### 6. Bought By Many

**Domain:** boughtbymany.com  
**Industry:** InsurTech (Pet Insurance)  
**Headcount:** ~200  
**HQ:** London, UK  
**Careers Page:** https://www.boughtbymany.com/careers

**Key Decision Maker:**
- **Name:** TBC
- **Title:** People Director
- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/company/bought-by-many/people/
- **Email:** firstname.lastname@boughtbymany.com

**Personalised Hook:**  
"You're growing fast in the pet insurance market (recently acquired by Pinnacle Pet Group), but your employer brand hasn't kept pace. AI barely knows you exist as an employer. When candidates research 'best insurtech companies UK', you don't appear. Our audit shows where you rank vs. competitors and what content you need to build awareness."

---

### 7. Fidel API

**Domain:** fidel.uk  
**Industry:** Payments API / SaaS  
**Headcount:** ~120  
**HQ:** London, UK  
**Careers Page:** https://fidel.uk/careers

**Key Decision Maker:**
- **Name:** TBC
- **Title:** Head of People Operations
- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/company/fidel-uk/people/
- **Email:** firstname.lastname@fidel.uk

**Personalised Hook:**  
"Fidel API is a developer-first product, but your careers content doesn't reflect that. No tech blog, minimal engineering presence, thin culture storytelling. When senior engineers research you on AI, they get payment infrastructure details but no employer narrative. Small team, big opportunity to own your niche in AI-powered talent search."

---

### 8. Beam

**Domain:** beam.org  
**Industry:** Social Impact Tech  
**Headcount:** ~150  
**HQ:** London, UK  
**Careers Page:** https://beam.org/careers  
**Live Roles:** 8+ (Product, Ops, Growth)  
**Glassdoor Rating:** 4.5/5 (38 reviews)

**Key Decision Maker:**
- **Name:** TBC
- **Title:** People & Culture Lead
- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/company/beam-homeless/people/
- **Email:** firstname.lastname@beam.org

**Personalised Hook:**  
"Beam has incredible mission-driven culture (4.5 on Glassdoor!) and you've helped thousands escape homelessness. But your careers page is minimal and AI can't find your story. When candidates search for 'purpose-driven tech jobs UK', you should rank #1. Our audit shows what's missing to attract mission-aligned talent at scale."

---

### 9. Cuvama

**Domain:** cuvama.com  
**Industry:** AI / Workplace Analytics  
**Headcount:** ~180  
**HQ:** London, UK  
**Careers Page:** https://www.cuvama.com/careers  
**Live Roles:** 6+ (Engineering, Product, Sales)  
**Glassdoor Rating:** N/A (too new)

**Key Decision Maker:**
- **Name:** TBC
- **Title:** Head of Talent
- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/company/cuvama/people/
- **Email:** firstname.lastname@cuvama.com

**Personalised Hook:**  
"Cuvama is building AI for workplace insights, but you have almost zero employer brand presence. No Glassdoor reviews yet, minimal careers content, and AI knows nothing about you as an employer. You're in prime position to build your employer narrative from scratch - our audit shows where you currently rank (or don't) vs. competitors."

---

### 10. Kharon

**Domain:** kharon.com  
**Industry:** Data Intelligence / SaaS  
**Headcount:** ~150  
**HQ:** London (+ NYC)  
**Careers Page:** https://www.kharon.com/careers  
**Live Roles:** 7+ (Engineering, Data, Intel)  
**Glassdoor Rating:** 3.5/5 (42 reviews)

**Key Decision Maker:**
- **Name:** TBC
- **Title:** VP of People
- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/company/kharon/people/
- **Email:** firstname.lastname@kharon.com

**Personalised Hook:**  
"Kharon provides risk intelligence to governments and Fortune 500s - serious, important work. But your employer story is invisible. Glassdoor reviews mention 'interesting work, unclear career paths'. When researchers ask AI about working at Kharon, they get product info only. We'll show you what your employer brand looks like to AI - and how to fix it."

### Fintech Companies (5)

### 11. Wagestream

**Domain:** wagestream.com  
**Industry:** Fintech / Earned Wage Access  
**Headcount:** ~250  
**HQ:** London, UK  
**Careers Page:** https://www.wagestream.com/careers  
**Live Roles:** 9+ (Product, Eng, Commercial)  
**Glassdoor Rating:** 3.9/5 (88 reviews)

**Key Decision Maker:**
- **Name:** TBC
- **Title:** Chief People Officer
- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/company/wagestream/people/
- **Email:** firstname.lastname@wagestream.com

**Personalised Hook:**  
"Wagestream helps workers access their wages instantly, solving real financial stress. But your own employee benefits story isn't clear in AI search. You should be THE fintech to work for if you care about financial wellness - yet AI can't articulate that. Our audit shows how your employer brand compares to Monzo, Revolut, etc."

---

### 12. Chip

**Domain:** getchip.uk  
**Industry:** Fintech / Savings App  
**Headcount:** ~130  
**HQ:** London, UK  
**Careers Page:** https://www.getchip.uk/careers  
**Live Roles:** 6+ (Product, Engineering, Growth)  
**Glassdoor Rating:** 3.7/5 (35 reviews)

**Key Decision Maker:**
- **Name:** TBC
- **Title:** Head of People
- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/company/chipfinancial/people/
- **Email:** firstname.lastname@getchip.uk

**Personalised Hook:**  
"Chip's product is smart and user-friendly, but your careers messaging is generic. No clear culture story, minimal team content, thin benefits page. When candidates ask AI 'what's it like to work at Chip?', they get basic company info - not employer insights. You're competing with dozens of UK fintechs for the same talent. Stand out in AI search."

---

### 13. Freetrade

**Domain:** freetrade.io  
**Industry:** Fintech / Investment App  
**Headcount:** ~180  
**HQ:** London, UK  
**Careers Page:** https://freetrade.io/careers  
**Live Roles:** 8+ (Engineering, Product, Ops)  
**Glassdoor Rating:** 3.8/5 (64 reviews)

**Key Decision Maker:**
- **Name:** TBC
- **Title:** People Director
- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/company/freetrade/people/
- **Email:** firstname.lastname@freetrade.io

**Personalised Hook:**  
"Freetrade democratizes investing - and should democratize your employer brand too. AI surfaces some Glassdoor negatives ('fast pace, unclear strategy') from 2022-2023. You've evolved since then, but AI doesn't reflect it. Our audit shows what candidates see when they research you via ChatGPT/Claude - and how to update that narrative."

---

### 14. Habito

**Domain:** habito.com  
**Industry:** Fintech / Mortgage Platform  
**Headcount:** ~160  
**HQ:** London, UK  
**Careers Page:** https://www.habito.com/careers  
**Live Roles:** 7+ (Tech, Product, Operations)  
**Glassdoor Rating:** 3.6/5 (71 reviews)

**Key Decision Maker:**
- **Name:** TBC
- **Title:** Head of Talent
- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/company/habito/people/
- **Email:** firstname.lastname@habito.com

**Personalised Hook:**  
"Habito makes mortgages simple, but your talent attraction isn't. You've pivoted business models, gone through changes - and Glassdoor reflects old pain points. AI doesn't know your current story. You're hiring again after restructuring, but employer brand lags reality. Our audit shows the perception gap and how to close it fast."

---

### 15. Zego

**Domain:** zego.com  
**Industry:** InsurTech / Commercial Insurance  
**Headcount:** ~350  
**HQ:** London (+ Europe)  
**Careers Page:** https://www.zego.com/careers  
**Live Roles:** 11+ (Engineering, Product, Commercial)  
**Glassdoor Rating:** 3.9/5 (102 reviews)

**Key Decision Maker:**
- **Name:** TBC
- **Title:** VP of People
- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/company/zego/people/
- **Email:** firstname.lastname@zego.com

**Personalised Hook:**  
"Zego is scaling fast (350+ people, multi-market expansion), but Glassdoor mentions 'culture dilution' and 'growing pains'. AI surfaces these concerns when candidates research you. You need to actively manage your employer narrative during hypergrowth. Our audit shows what AI tells candidates about Zego culture - and where you can reframe the story."

### 16. Gousto

**Domain:** gousto.co.uk  
**Industry:** Food Tech / Meal Kits  
**Headcount:** ~480  
**HQ:** London, UK  
**Careers Page:** https://www.gousto.co.uk/careers  
**Live Roles:** 14+ (Tech, Ops, Product, Marketing)  
**Glassdoor Rating:** 3.5/5 (195 reviews)

**Key Decision Maker:**
- **Name:** TBC
- **Title:** Head of Talent Acquisition
- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/company/gousto/people/
- **Email:** firstname.lastname@gousto.co.uk

**Personalised Hook:**  
"Gousto is a major UK food tech player with nearly 500 employees, but Glassdoor is mixed (3.5/5 with complaints about pace and pressure). When AI summarizes your employer brand, it highlights negatives. You likely have great stories to tell - sustainability, tech innovation, food quality - but they're not surfacing in AI search. Our audit shows the narrative gap."

---

### 17. Elvie

**Domain:** elvie.com  
**Industry:** FemTech / Consumer Health  
**Headcount:** ~220  
**HQ:** London (global offices)  
**Careers Page:** https://www.elvie.com/careers  
**Live Roles:** 9+ (Engineering, Product, Commercial)  
**Glassdoor Rating:** 4.1/5 (78 reviews)

**Key Decision Maker:**
- **Name:** TBC
- **Title:** Chief People Officer
- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/company/elvie/people/
- **Email:** firstname.lastname@elvie.com

**Personalised Hook:**  
"Elvie's product brand is world-class - innovative, beautifully designed, mission-driven. But your employer brand doesn't match that strength. Careers content is thin, culture storytelling is minimal, and AI can't answer 'what's it like to work at Elvie?' You should own the FemTech employer brand space. Our audit shows where you rank vs. competitors."

---

### 18. Bloom & Wild

**Domain:** bloomandwild.com  
**Industry:** E-commerce / Flower Delivery  
**Headcount:** ~200  
**HQ:** London (+ Europe)  
**Careers Page:** https://www.bloomandwild.com/careers  
**Live Roles:** 8+ (Tech, Ops, Marketing)  
**Glassdoor Rating:** 3.8/5 (84 reviews)

**Key Decision Maker:**
- **Name:** TBC
- **Title:** People Director
- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/company/bloom-and-wild/people/
- **Email:** firstname.lastname@bloomandwild.com

**Personalised Hook:**  
"Bloom & Wild's brand is beautiful and distinctive - but your careers page lacks personality. Generic job descriptions, minimal culture content, no team stories. When candidates ask AI about working at Bloom & Wild, they get 'flower delivery company' - not a compelling employer narrative. You're competing for ecommerce talent against giants. Stand out through culture."

---

### 19. Butternut Box

**Domain:** butternutbox.com  
**Industry:** Pet Food / D2C  
**Headcount:** ~400  
**HQ:** London, UK  
**Careers Page:** https://www.butternutbox.com/careers  
**Live Roles:** 13+ (Tech, Ops, Vet team, Commercial)  
**Glassdoor Rating:** 4.0/5 (96 reviews)

**Key Decision Maker:**
- **Name:** TBC
- **Title:** Head of People
- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/company/butternut-box/people/
- **Email:** firstname.lastname@butternutbox.com

**Personalised Hook:**  
"Butternut Box is growing incredibly fast (400+ people, strong Glassdoor score), but your careers content is thin for your size. No engineering blog, limited culture content, minimal employer brand investment. You're hiring across 10+ roles right now - but AI can't tell candidates why Butternut Box is a great place to work. Our audit shows the content gaps."

### 20. Octopus Energy Labs

**Domain:** octopusenergy.com/careers  
**Industry:** Energy Tech / Software  
**Headcount:** ~320 (tech division)  
**HQ:** London, UK  
**Careers Page:** https://octopusenergy.com/careers/tech  
**Live Roles:** 10+ (Engineering, Product, Data)  
**Glassdoor Rating:** 4.2/5 (combined with parent)

**Key Decision Maker:**
- **Name:** TBC
- **Title:** Tech Talent Lead
- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/company/octopus-energy/people/
- **Email:** firstname.lastname@octopusenergy.com

**Personalised Hook:**  
"Octopus Energy Labs is the tech arm of a beloved UK brand - but you're buried under the parent company's employer brand. Tech talent doesn't know you exist as a distinct, software-first team. When engineers ask AI about energy tech jobs, they don't see Octopus Labs. You need your own employer identity. Our audit shows how to separate signal from noise."
