**Date:** February 2026  
**Purpose:** Map content clusters, anchor text recommendations, and linking architecture for maximum SEO impact.

## Content Cluster Architecture

We're using a **pillar + spoke model** where comprehensive guide posts (pillars) link to specialized deep-dives (spokes), and all spokes link back to pillars.

### Pillar 1: AI SEO Complete Guide
**URL:** `/blog/ai-seo-complete-guide`

**Spoke posts:**
- How AI Models Decide What to Say (`/blog/how-ai-decides`)
- The llms.txt Myth (`/blog/llms-txt-myth`)
- Structured Data Guide (`/blog/structured-data-guide`)
- AI Score Explained (`/blog/ai-score-explained`)

**Product pages:**
- Free Audit Tool (`/`)
- Pricing (`/pricing`)
- JSON-LD Generator (`/tools/employer-schema`)

---

### Pillar 2: Cost of AI Misinformation (CFO-angle)
**URL:** `/blog/cost-of-ai-misinformation`

**Spoke posts:**
- AI SEO Complete Guide (`/blog/ai-seo-complete-guide`) — implementation roadmap
- How AI Models Decide (`/blog/how-ai-decides`) — technical context
- AI Score Explained (`/blog/ai-score-explained`) — measurement

**Product pages:**
- Free Audit Tool (`/`) — "see what AI says about your salaries"
- Pricing (`/pricing`) — ROI calculator context

---

### Pillar 3: Structured Data Guide (Developer audience)
**URL:** `/blog/structured-data-guide`

**Spoke posts:**
- How AI Models Decide (`/blog/how-ai-decides`) — why structured data matters
- AI SEO Complete Guide (`/blog/ai-seo-complete-guide`) — broader context
- The llms.txt Myth (`/blog/llms-txt-myth`) — what doesn't work

**Product pages:**
- JSON-LD Generator (`/tools/employer-schema`) — automated implementation
- Free Audit Tool (`/`) — validate your implementation

## Page-by-Page Linking Plan

## Anchor Text Best Practices

### DO Use These Anchor Texts:

**For comprehensive guide:**
- "complete guide to AI SEO for employer branding"
- "AI SEO complete guide"
- "implementation roadmap"

**For technical posts:**
- "how AI models decide what to say"
- "technical deep-dive into AI citations"
- "structured data implementation guide"

**For contrarian post:**
- "the llms.txt myth debunked"
- "why llms.txt doesn't work"

**For CFO post:**
- "cost of AI misinformation"
- "financial impact of AI hallucinations"
- "ROI of AI visibility"

**For product links:**
- "free Rankwell audit"
- "run a free audit"
- "check what AI says about you"
- "JSON-LD generator"
- "employer schema generator"

---

### DON'T Use These (Over-Optimization):

❌ "best AI SEO tool"
❌ "click here"
❌ "read more"
❌ "AI SEO" (naked keyword)
❌ "employer brand AI tool"

---

## Link Placement Strategy

### Within Blog Content

**Ideal placement:**
1. **Introduction** (after the hook, before main content)
   - Link to related pillar post for context

2. **Mid-content** (after explaining a concept)
   - Link to deep-dive post or tool

3. **Conclusion** (call-to-action)
   - Link to free audit tool
   - Link to pricing (if discussing implementation)

4. **FAQ section**
   - Link to relevant explainer posts

**Example flow (AI SEO Complete Guide):**

```
Introduction:
"Before implementing, understand [how AI models decide](/blog/how-ai-decides)..."

Section 3 (After explaining structured data):
"See our complete [structured data implementation guide](/blog/structured-data-guide)..."

Section 6 (Common mistakes):
"Don't waste time on [the llms.txt myth](/blog/llms-txt-myth)..."

Conclusion:
"[Run a free Rankwell audit](/) to see what AI says about you now."
```

- [ ] Add to footer resources if it's a pillar

**Monthly:**
- [ ] Review top 10 blog posts — ensure they link to latest content
- [ ] Update anchor text if new posts are more relevant
- [ ] Check for orphan pages (no internal links)
- [ ] Verify all links work (no 404s)

## Conclusion

Internal linking is **not set-and-forget**. As we publish more content:
- New posts should link to relevant older posts
- Older posts should be updated to link to new deep-dives
- Product pages should link to the most relevant blog content

**Goal:** Every page should be reachable from the homepage within 3 clicks. Every blog post should link to the free audit tool.

**Success metric:** 10-15% of blog readers convert to free audit users. Internal linking drives this.
