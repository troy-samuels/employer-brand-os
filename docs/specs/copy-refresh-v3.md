# OpenRole — Copy Refresh (v3 Strategy Alignment)
**Date:** 24 Feb 2026
**Purpose:** Reframe existing copy around the Diagnose → Fix → Prove thesis. Speak to three ICPs. Anchor value to candidate behaviour, not feature lists.

---

## The Three ICPs

### ICP 1: Head of Talent / HR Director
**Title:** Head of Talent, Talent Acquisition Director, HR Director
**Company:** 100-2,000 employees, UK
**Pain:** Spending £5K-15K/year on Glassdoor and LinkedIn, getting zero insight into what AI tells candidates. Candidates ghost interviews or reject offers for reasons nobody can explain.
**Motivation:** Control the narrative. Stop losing candidates to misinformation.
**Language:** ROI, cost-per-hire, talent pipeline, employer brand, candidate experience
**Buys at:** Control (£119/mo) — credit card threshold, no procurement

### ICP 2: Employer Brand Manager / People & Culture Lead
**Title:** Employer Brand Manager, EVP Lead, People & Culture Manager
**Company:** 200-2,000 employees
**Pain:** Spent £30K on an EVP project last year. None of that content appears when candidates ask ChatGPT. The careers page looks great but AI doesn't cite it.
**Motivation:** Prove their work is visible where candidates actually research. Justify their budget.
**Language:** Brand consistency, discoverability, candidate perception, content strategy
**Buys at:** Compete (£239/mo) — needs competitor benchmarks to justify spend to VP

### ICP 3: VP Talent / CHRO (Budget Approver)
**Title:** VP People, CHRO, Chief People Officer
**Company:** 500-5,000 employees
**Pain:** Board asks "why can't we hire fast enough?" Has no data on AI's role in candidate decision-making. Needs something quantifiable.
**Motivation:** Data for the board. Competitive advantage. Risk mitigation.
**Language:** Competitive intelligence, data-driven, strategic advantage, talent market share
**Buys at:** Command (£479/mo) or Enterprise — needs ROI case, strategic narrative

## Hero Section

### Current
```
AI is answering questions about you.
Are you feeding it the right data?
```

### Recommended (v3 — candidate-centric)
```
Every candidate researches you through AI before they apply.
What are they finding?
```

**Subline (current):**
> OpenRole injects a machine-readable data layer into your existing website. When ChatGPT, Perplexity or Google AI researches your company, it finds your verified facts — not Glassdoor rumours from 2022.

**Subline (v3):**
> Candidates ask ChatGPT about your salary, culture, and interview process every day. We show you exactly what AI tells them — then make sure it's right.

**Why this is better:** The current headline is about data infrastructure. The v3 headline is about candidates — the thing HR leaders actually care about. "Feeding it the right data" is a solution. "What are they finding?" is a threat. Threats convert faster.

### ICP resonance:
- **ICP 1 (Head of Talent):** "Every candidate researches you" — directly addresses their pipeline
- **ICP 2 (Brand Manager):** "What are they finding?" — triggers fear that their brand work is invisible
- **ICP 3 (VP/CHRO):** Implies a measurable, knowable problem — data they don't have yet

---

## Problem Stats Section

### Current
```
800M — people use ChatGPT every week — and they're asking about your company
68% — of UK employers have no machine-readable salary or benefits data for AI to cite
32/100 — average employer AI visibility score. Glassdoor fills the silence.
```

### Recommended (v3 — simulate the candidate's perspective)
```
800M — weekly ChatGPT users. Your next hire is one of them.
6 out of 10 — candidate queries return hallucinated or outdated employer data.
£4,500 — average UK cost-per-hire. One wrong AI answer costs you the candidate.
```

**Why:** The current stats are about the employer's technical gap. The v3 stats follow the candidate journey: they're using AI → AI gets it wrong → that costs you money. Each stat maps to a different ICP's fear:

- **800M** → ICP 2 (Brand Manager) — "My brand isn't showing up where it matters"
- **6 out of 10** → ICP 1 (Head of Talent) — "Candidates are getting bad info before they apply"
- **£4,500** → ICP 3 (VP/CHRO) — "This has a hard cost"

## Features Section (Audit → Fix → Deploy)

### Current
```
Audit — See what AI says about you right now — word for word.
Fill in the gaps — Input your real data: salaries, benefits, remote policy.
Deploy — Add two lines to your website. Track the impact weekly.
```

### Recommended (v3 — Diagnose → Fix → Prove)
```
Diagnose — We run the exact questions candidates ask about you through
ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini. You see every answer, every
hallucination, every gap — word for word.

Fix — We generate the structured data, schema markup, and content that
feeds AI your verified facts. Installed on your domain, where the
authority lives. Not a third-party profile.

Prove — Track AI bot crawls on your site. See when ChatGPT cites your
verified data. Measure how your AI visibility score improves week over
week. Real numbers, not promises.
```

**Why:** "Fill in the gaps" sounds like data entry. "Fix" sounds like action. "Deploy" sounds technical. "Prove" sounds like ROI. The v3 version follows the emotional arc: shock (Diagnose) → relief (Fix) → confidence (Prove).

### ICP resonance:
- **ICP 1:** "Diagnose" = immediate value, no commitment. "Prove" = data for their weekly report
- **ICP 2:** "Fix" = their content strategy now has an AI-specific dimension they can own
- **ICP 3:** "Prove" = the board-ready metric they've been missing

## Pricing Section

### Current tier names and copy
```
Control — Monitor & start fixing — £119/mo

### Why this framing works:

| Tier | ICP it speaks to | Emotional trigger |
|---|---|---|
| **Know** (Control) | ICP 1 — Head of Talent | "I didn't even know this was happening" → awareness |
| **Fix** (Compete) | ICP 2 — Brand Manager | "I can actually do something about this" → action |
| **Own** (Command) | ICP 3 — VP/CHRO | "We're ahead of competitors on this" → strategic advantage |

The progression isn't feature-based — it's maturity-based. Know → Fix → Own. Each tier is a stage in how seriously the company takes AI-era employer branding.

## CTA Copy

### Current audit input placeholder:
> (Need to check — likely "Enter your company name")

### Recommended:
> "See what AI tells candidates about you"

**Button:** "Run free audit"

**Below input:** "340+ UK employers audited · Takes 30 seconds · No signup required"

### Post-audit CTA:
**Current:** (Unknown — need to check)
**Recommended:** "This is what candidates see. Ready to fix it?"

---

## Social Proof / Evidence Bar

### Recommended stats (update as data grows):
```
340+ employers audited
68% had hallucinated salary data
Average score improvement: 32 → 71 in 8 weeks
"We had no idea ChatGPT was telling candidates our interview process wrong."
— Head of Talent, [Company]
```

## Key Copy Principles for All Pages

1. **Lead with the candidate, not the technology.** Never say "machine-readable data layer" above the fold. Say "what candidates hear when they ask AI about you."

2. **Every feature description answers "so what?"** Not "weekly monitoring across 4 AI models" but "see what ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini tell candidates about you every week."

3. **Anchor price to cost-per-hire, not software.** £239/mo = £2,868/year. One avoided bad hire (average £4,500 cost-per-hire) pays for 19 months of OpenRole.

4. **Use "candidates" not "users" or "people."** HR leaders think in candidates. Every sentence should make them picture a real person deciding whether to apply.

5. **The audit is the product demo.** No "book a demo" gate. The free audit IS the demo. Every copy element drives toward "run the audit."

6. **Threat before solution.** Headline = threat (what are candidates finding?). Body = solution (we fix it). CTA = proof (see your score). This follows the classic Problem → Agitate → Solve framework but anchored to a specific, measurable threat.

## Implementation Note

These are copy changes, not redesigns. The UI structure stays. The components stay. We're swapping words, not layouts. This should be a 1-2 day sprint to update all copy across the site.
