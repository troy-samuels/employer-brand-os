# AI SEO Landscape Research: Comprehensive Market Analysis for OpenRole

**Prepared for:** OpenRole (openrole.co.uk)  
**Date:** 19 February 2026  
**Classification:** Internal — Product Strategy  
**Research Standard:** Institutional-grade, fully sourced

---

## Executive Summary

The AI SEO market — encompassing tools and services that optimise brand visibility across AI-powered search platforms — has reached **$2.2 billion** in 2025, growing at 10–34% annually depending on the segment. The broader SEO software market sits at **$84.94 billion** (Precedence Research, 2025).

**The seismic shift:** Search behaviour is fragmenting. Google AI Overviews now reach **2 billion monthly users**. ChatGPT has **700 million weekly active users**. ~60% of searches now end without a click. AI Overviews reduce organic CTR for position-one content by **58%** (Ahrefs, Feb 2026). Yet AI search visitors are **4.4x more valuable** than traditional organic visitors (Semrush, 2025).

**OpenRole's unique position:** No other tool in the market specifically combines **employer brand monitoring** with **AI search optimisation** for the talent acquisition use case. Competitors like Profound, Otterly.ai, and Peec AI serve general brand/marketing teams. Traditional employer brand platforms (Glassdoor for Employers, LinkedIn Talent Solutions, Comparably) have no AI search optimisation capability. PerceptionX is the closest competitor but focuses on measurement rather than optimisation.

**The opportunity:** Candidates are rapidly shifting to AI tools for company research, with AI-driven traffic to career sites surging **1,300%** recently (PerceptionX, 2025). 80% of job seekers now use ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini to research companies (PerceptionX). Yet TA teams lack the tools, training, and budgets to manage AI-driven employer reputation — a gap OpenRole is positioned to fill.

**Key recommendation:** OpenRole should aggressively build its GEO (Generative Engine Optimisation) capabilities for employer brand, establish thought leadership in the "AI Employer Brand" category, and expand from monitoring to active optimisation tools within the next 90 days.

## 1. Market Definition & Size

### 1.1 Defining "AI SEO"

"AI SEO" encompasses three distinct but overlapping market segments:

1. **AI-Powered Traditional SEO Tools:** Software using AI/ML to automate and improve traditional search engine optimisation (content optimisation, keyword research, technical SEO). Examples: Surfer SEO, Clearscope, MarketMuse, Frase.

2. **Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO):** A new category focused on optimising brand visibility specifically within AI-generated responses from LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity. This includes monitoring AI mentions, tracking citations, and optimising content for AI retrieval. Examples: Profound, Otterly.ai, Peec AI.

3. **Answer Engine Optimisation (AEO):** Overlaps with GEO but includes optimisation for Google AI Overviews, AI Mode, and other AI-enhanced search results within traditional search engines. This is rapidly merging with GEO.

The market also divides by **application:**
- **Content Optimisation:** Tools that help create content ranking well in both traditional and AI search
- **AI Visibility Monitoring:** Tools that track how brands appear in AI-generated responses
- **AI Brand Management:** Platforms that help brands influence what AI says about them
- **Employer Brand AI Optimisation:** OpenRole's niche — optimising how AI portrays companies to job candidates

| Platform | What They Do | AI Search Capability? | Pricing |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|---------|
| **Glassdoor for Employers** | Review management, employer profile, job posting | None — no AI search monitoring | $$$ (enterprise pricing) |
| **LinkedIn Talent Solutions** | Employer branding, job posting, talent insights | None — closed platform (not crawled by LLMs) | $$$ (enterprise pricing) |
| **Comparably** | Employer brand analytics, culture benchmarking | None | $$ |
| **Indeed Employer** | Reviews, employer profile | None | $$ |
| **Universum** | Employer brand research and strategy | None | $$$ (consultancy) |

**Critical gap:** None of the traditional employer brand platforms offer any AI search monitoring or optimisation. LinkedIn is a closed platform that AI tools cannot crawl. This is OpenRole's strongest competitive advantage.

> Source: Rally Recruitment Marketing, Jan 2026 — "For TA, there's really only one built specifically for this [AI employer brand]. So the gap isn't just knowledge — it's infrastructure."

### 5.2 Features MISSING from the Market

1. **Employer Brand GEO Toolkit:** No tool combines AI monitoring + employer brand optimisation + candidate-journey mapping in one platform
2. **Structured Employer Data Publishing:** No platform generates machine-readable employer data (schema.org/JobPosting, Organization, EmployerAggregateRating) specifically optimised for AI retrieval
3. **Candidate Prompt Library:** No tool maintains a library of prompts candidates actually use when researching employers via AI
4. **Cross-Platform Employer Narrative Consistency:** No tool audits whether your employer story is consistent across Glassdoor, LinkedIn, career site, and AI responses
5. **AI Hallucination Correction for Employers:** Beyond monitoring, no tool actively publishes correction data that AI models can reference to fix employer-specific hallucinations
6. **Industry/Role Benchmarking:** No tool benchmarks employer AI visibility by industry vertical or role type
7. **HR/TA Team Dashboards:** All existing tools assume marketing/SEO users; none are designed for HR/talent acquisition workflows
8. **Cost-of-Hire Impact Modelling:** No tool connects AI employer brand visibility to recruiting outcomes (cost per hire, application quality, offer acceptance rate)

### 5.3 Where OpenRole Is Uniquely Positioned

OpenRole occupies a unique intersection that no competitor covers:

```
                    AI SEARCH OPTIMISATION
                           ↑
                           |
        Profound ----+---- Otterly
        Peec AI      |     Ahrefs BR
                     |
    MARKETING ←------+------→ EMPLOYER BRAND
    TEAMS            |         TEAMS
                     |
        Semrush ----+---- PerceptionX
        Jasper       |     Glassdoor
                     |     LinkedIn
                           ↓
                    TRADITIONAL SEO/REVIEWS
```

**OpenRole sits squarely in the top-right quadrant:** AI Search Optimisation × Employer Brand. No other tool fully occupies this space.

### 5.4 What OpenRole Should Build Next (Based on Gaps)

**Priority 1 (Critical):**
- Structured employer data publishing (machine-readable)
- Candidate prompt library and tracking
- GEO audit with employer-specific recommendations

**Priority 2 (Differentiating):**
- Cross-platform narrative consistency audit
- Glassdoor/Indeed review integration and response recommendations
- Cost-of-hire impact modelling

**Priority 3 (Future moat):**
- AI agent optimisation (preparing for when AI agents autonomously research employers on behalf of candidates)
- Employer schema.org markup generator
- Integration with ATS systems (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday)

## 6. Pricing Landscape

### 6.1 How AI SEO Tools Are Priced

| Pricing Model | Examples | Notes |

| Limited free plan | MarketMuse (10 queries/mo), Frase (7-day trial) | Traditional SaaS approach |
| Free trial (time-limited) | Otterly.ai (14 days), Frase (7 days) | Requires sign-up, credit card sometimes |
| No free option | Profound, Clearscope, Ahrefs BR | Enterprise gate — reduces tire-kickers |

### 6.4 Pricing Recommendation for OpenRole

OpenRole's current pricing (£49/£149/£399) is well-positioned:
- **Below** Clearscope ($129), Brand24 ($149), Ahrefs Brand Radar ($199)
- **Competitive with** Frase ($39–$239), Otterly.ai ($29+)
- **Free audit** is a major competitive advantage — no competitor offers instant, free employer brand AI auditing

**Recommendation:** Maintain current pricing but add:
1. **Annual discount** (20–25% off, like Frase's model) to improve retention
2. **Agency tier** ($999–$1,499/mo) for recruitment agencies managing multiple clients
3. **Enterprise tier** with custom pricing for large employers (50+ locations, custom prompts)
4. Keep the free audit forever — it's the best conversion tool in the market

## 7. Key Trends & Signals (2025–2026)

### 7.1 AI Agents and Brand Visibility

AI agents (autonomous AI systems that act on behalf of users) are emerging as the next evolution of AI search. Instead of candidates manually asking ChatGPT about a company, AI career agents will:
- Autonomously research companies matching a candidate's criteria
- Compare employer brands across multiple dimensions
- Make recommendations without human prompting
- Potentially apply to jobs on the candidate's behalf

**Impact for employer brand:** Companies will need machine-readable, structured employer data that AI agents can reliably parse. Profound already has "Agent Analytics" as a feature category. This is an early signal of where the market is heading.

**OpenRole opportunity:** Build "Agent-Ready Employer Profiles" — structured data packages that AI agents can consume to accurately represent companies to candidates.

### 7.2 Structured Data / Schema Markup for AI

Schema markup is increasingly important for AI citation:
- Structured data improves AI citation likelihood by **30–40%** (MktClarity, 2025)
- Relevant schema types for employer brand: `Organization`, `EmployerAggregateRating`, `JobPosting`, `Review`, `FAQPage`, `HowTo`
- Google AI Overviews preferentially cite structured data sources
- .gov websites are overrepresented in AI summaries (6% vs 2% in standard results) — structured data is a factor

### 7.3 AI Crawl Blocking (robots.txt trends)

A growing number of publishers are blocking AI crawlers:
- Major news publishers blocking GPTBot, ClaudeBot, etc.
- However, blocking AI crawlers means your content won't be cited in AI responses — a trade-off
- For employer brand: NOT blocking AI crawlers is critical — you *want* AI to cite your career pages
- Profound's "Agent Analytics" feature tracks which AI bots access your content and how often

**OpenRole opportunity:** Guide employers on optimal AI crawl settings. Many companies may inadvertently block AI crawlers on their career sites.

### 7.4 Brand Entity Optimisation

AI systems increasingly think in terms of "entities" (brands, people, concepts) rather than keywords:
- Consistent brand information across Wikipedia, Wikidata, Google Knowledge Graph, and Crunchbase influences how AI understands and represents your brand
- Employee advocacy on LinkedIn creates brand entity signals that AI systems pick up
- PR and earned media contribute to brand entity strength

**For employer brand:** Companies need to ensure their employer entity is well-defined across all public data sources AI systems reference.

### 7.5 E-E-A-T in the AI Era

Google's E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) framework is increasingly relevant for AI citation:
- Content with transparent author bios significantly increases AI citation rates
- AI systems preferentially cite authoritative, well-sourced content
- For employer brand: Employee testimonials, leadership content, and verified company data all strengthen E-E-A-T signals
- Google's 2025 Search Quality Rater Guidelines emphasise that fully AI-generated content (with no original content) should receive the lowest rating (Originality.ai, Sep 2025)

> Source: Originality.ai, "AI Content in Google Search Results," Sep 2025 — https://originality.ai/ai-content-in-google-search-results

### 7.6 AI-Generated Content Detection and Ranking

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| AI content in Google top 20 results (Feb 2019) | 2.27% | Originality.ai |
| AI content in Google top 20 results (Jul 2025) | 19.56% (peak) | Originality.ai |
| AI content in Google top 20 results (Sep 2025) | 17.31% | Originality.ai |
| AI content ranking in positions 1-10 | ~2/3 rank in bottom 50% of results | Semrush (2025) |

Google has shown it can detect and penalise pure AI content (March 2024 core update dropped AI content from 8.48% to 7.43%). However, AI-assisted content continues to rank well when combined with original expertise and value.

### 7.7 Gen Z and Conversational Search

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Gen Z using AI chatbots for search | ~35% | Claneo (2025) |
| LLM users researching/summarising information | 68% | Bain & Company (2024) |
| LLM users asking shopping recommendations | 42% | Bain & Company (2024) |
| LLM users checking news/weather | 48% | Bain & Company (2024) |

Gen Z (now entering the workforce en masse) is the first "AI-native" generation of job seekers. They're more likely to ask ChatGPT "what's it like to work at [company]?" than to visit a career site directly. This makes AI employer brand optimisation not a nice-to-have but a necessity for attracting young talent.

### 7.8 The Shift from SEO to AEO/GEO

The industry is coalescing around new terminology:
- **AEO** (Answer Engine Optimisation): Optimising for AI-generated answers
- **GEO** (Generative Engine Optimisation): Optimising specifically for generative AI platforms
- **LLM Optimisation / LLMO**: Broader term for optimising content for LLMs

These are not replacing SEO but adding a parallel discipline. 63% of marketers now prioritise GEO (MktClarity), and 75% of digital agencies have launched GEO services.

## 8. Customer Segments & Pain Points

### 8.1 Who Is Buying AI SEO Tools

| Segment | What They Buy | Budget Range | Key Motivation |
|---------|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Enterprise Marketing** | Profound, Semrush Enterprise, Ahrefs BR | $5K–$50K/mo | Protect brand visibility in AI |
| **SMB Marketing** | Frase, Otterly.ai, NeuronWriter | $50–$500/mo | Affordable AI content + visibility |
| **SEO Agencies** | Surfer, Clearscope, Frase | $100–$1K/mo per client | Client deliverables, scale |
| **Content Teams** | Frase, Clearscope, MarketMuse | $100–$400/mo | Content quality, ranking improvement |
| **E-commerce** | Profound (Shopping), Semrush | $500–$5K/mo | Product visibility in ChatGPT Shopping |
| **HR/TA Teams** | **OpenRole**, PerceptionX, Built In | £49–£399/mo (OpenRole) | Employer brand in AI |

### 8.2 Top Pain Points

**General AI SEO Pain Points:**
1. "I don't know how my brand appears in AI responses" (visibility gap)
2. "AI is saying inaccurate things about my company" (hallucination problem)
3. "My organic traffic is declining but I don't know what to do about AI" (strategy gap)
4. "I can't measure ROI of AI optimisation" (measurement gap)
5. "The tools are too expensive / complex for my team" (accessibility gap)

**Employer Brand Specific Pain Points:**
1. **"Candidates are asking ChatGPT about us and we have no idea what it says"** — The fundamental awareness gap
2. **"AI is hallucinating our salary data / benefits / culture"** — Specific employer-data accuracy issue
3. **"We invest in our careers page but AI doesn't cite it"** — Content not reaching AI systems
4. **"Our Glassdoor reviews dominate what AI says about us"** — Negative sentiment amplification
5. **"HR doesn't have the tools or budget for GEO"** — Infrastructure gap (per Rally webinar)
6. **"We're losing candidates before they even apply because AI painted a bad picture"** — Attribution difficulty
7. **"Our TA team isn't trained in SEO or GEO — and marketing won't help"** — Organisational gap

### 8.3 Enterprise vs SMB Approaches

| Dimension | Enterprise | SMB |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Tool preference | Custom/enterprise platforms (Profound, Semrush Enterprise) | Self-serve, affordable (Frase, Otterly, OpenRole) |
| Budget | $5K–$100K+/year | $500–$5K/year |
| Team | Dedicated employer brand / GEO specialists | HR generalists wearing multiple hats |
| Pain point | "Maintain visibility at scale across markets" | "Understand what AI says about us at all" |
| Decision process | Committee, procurement, long sales cycles | Founder/HR lead, quick trial-to-purchase |
| Key requirement | SSO, SOC 2, custom reporting, API | Simple UX, immediate value, affordable |

### 8.4 What HR/TA Teams Need Specifically

Based on the Rally Recruitment Marketing webinar (Jan 2026) and employer branding industry sources:

1. **Visibility into what AI says:** A simple dashboard showing AI responses to candidate queries
2. **Actionable recommendations:** Not just data but "do X to fix Y" guidance (HR teams are not SEO experts)
3. **Review management integration:** Connect Glassdoor/Indeed sentiment to AI reputation
4. **Competitive benchmarking:** How does our AI employer brand compare to talent competitors?
5. **Executive reporting:** Simple metrics to share with the C-suite (not marketing jargon)
6. **Content templates:** Pre-built employer content that AI systems prefer to cite
7. **Cost justification:** Clear connection between AI reputation and recruiting outcomes
8. **Low learning curve:** HR teams cannot become GEO experts; the tool must abstract complexity

These topics have virtually no competition because the category is so new:

1. **"AI employer brand score"** — OpenRole can define this term and own it

3. **"AI career site optimisation"** — Intersection of two large audiences, zero existing content

5. **"ChatGPT employer reviews"** — High candidate interest, zero optimised content
6. **"AI agent employer brand"** — Future-proofing thought leadership

### 9.4 Thought Leadership Strategy

To establish OpenRole as the definitive voice in AI employer brand:

1. **Publish original research monthly** — Run free audits on 100+ companies per month and publish aggregate insights

## Appendix B: Methodology Notes

This research was conducted using:
1. **Browser-based Google search** for market data, competitor discovery, and trend validation
2. **Direct website scraping** (web_fetch) for competitor pricing, features, and positioning
3. **Cross-referencing** across minimum 2 sources for all quantitative claims
4. **Date marking** for all data points to enable future freshness assessment

**Limitations:**
- Some competitor pricing (MarketMuse, PerceptionX, Peec AI) is not publicly available — estimates used where noted
- Gartner's full report was behind a paywall; data from press release and secondary sources
- McKinsey full article was not accessible; data from Google search snippet and secondary citations
- Market size estimates vary significantly between analyst firms (e.g., SEO software market ranges from $74.9B to $106.9B depending on definition)
- AI search traffic data is still nascent and methodologies differ between studies

**Data freshness commitment:** All data in this report should be re-validated within 90 days. The AI search landscape is evolving weekly.
