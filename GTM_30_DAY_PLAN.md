## 1. THE BEACHHEAD: FIRST 100 CUSTOMERS

### Who Is the EASIEST Customer to Sell To?

The easiest sale isn't the biggest company — it's the person whose **job literally depends** on employer perception and who has **budget authority under £5K/year**.

#### 🎯 Primary ICP: Employer Brand Managers & Heads of Talent Attraction

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Title** | Employer Brand Manager, Head of Talent Attraction, Recruitment Marketing Manager, Head of Resourcing |
| **Company size** | 500–5,000 employees |
| **Industries** | Tech, Financial Services, Professional Services, Healthcare, Retail (high-volume hiring) |
| **Geography** | UK first (regulatory tailwinds, home market), then EU |
| **Budget** | Own budget of £10K–£50K/year for EB tools/agencies |
| **Sign-off** | Self (under £5K) or VP Talent/CHRO (over £5K) |
| **Pain today** | Cannot measure ROI of employer brand spend. Board asks "what do candidates think?" — they have anecdotes, not data. |

**Why they buy TODAY:**
- They're already spending £20K–£100K/year on employer brand activities (EVP projects, careers sites, Glassdoor profiles)
- They have ZERO visibility into what AI says about them — and AI is now the first place candidates check
- The £199/month price is a rounding error in their budget — doesn't need procurement
- The free audit creates an instant "oh shit" moment they can take to their boss

#### 🎯 Secondary ICP: Employer Brand Agencies & RPOs

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Title** | Managing Director, Head of Strategy, Client Director |
| **Company type** | Employer brand agency, recruitment marketing agency, RPO |
| **Size** | 10–100 employees, managing 20–200 employer clients |
| **Budget** | Client pass-through (£99/client/month × 20+ clients = £2K+/month) |
| **Sign-off** | MD or Head of Strategy (immediate) |
| **Pain today** | Clients asking about AI and they have no answer. Losing pitches to agencies that claim AI expertise. |

**Why they buy TODAY:**
- Their clients are asking "What does ChatGPT say about us?" and they can't answer
- Rankwell becomes a new service line they can charge £500–£2,000/month for while paying £99/client
- It's a **retention tool** — clients who get weekly AI monitoring reports don't leave the agency
- They buy once, we get 20–100 employer accounts in one deal

#### 🎯 Tertiary ICP: HR Directors at High-Growth Companies

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Title** | HR Director, VP People, Chief People Officer |
| **Company size** | 100–500 employees, Series B+ or profitable |
| **Industries** | Tech, FinTech, HealthTech, CleanTech |
| **Budget** | HR tech budget £50K–£200K/year |
| **Sign-off** | Self (under £10K annual) |
| **Pain today** | Competing for talent against bigger brands. Losing candidates who "read something" about them. |

### Why They Would Buy TODAY — The Acute Pain Points

1. **The "Shadow Salary" problem is real and unaddressed.** When a candidate asks ChatGPT "What does [company] pay a Senior Developer?", AI fabricates an answer from stale data. The candidate then anchors on that number. Nobody else surfaces this problem.

2. **AI adoption among candidates is accelerating.** 40%+ of job searches now involve AI. Companies that are invisible to AI are losing candidates they never even knew existed.

3. **The Big Three have blocked AI.** Glassdoor, Indeed, and LinkedIn explicitly block AI crawlers from salary, review, and job data. This means the only employer brand information AI can access is whatever scraps exist on company websites — which are usually unstructured and unoptimized.

4. **EU Pay Transparency Directive hits June 2026.** Companies need structured salary data published. Rankwell provides this as a side effect of the core product.

5. **No one else does this.** Zero tools currently show companies what AI says about them as employers. This is category creation.

### 20 Specific UK Companies That Could Be Early Customers

#### Employer Brand Agencies (Buy at agency pricing, bring 20+ clients each)

| # | Company | HQ | Size | Why them |
|---|---------|-----|------|----------|
| 1 | **Chatter Communications** | Leeds | 11–50 | Award-winning EB agency. Already selling EVP, careers sites, engagement. Rankwell = new service line. |
| 2 | **ThirtyThree** | London | 20–50 | Specialist employer brand agency. Work with major UK brands. Need AI differentiation. |
| 3 | **Blackbridge Communications** | London | 10–30 | EB and internal comms agency. Clients include NHS trusts, councils. |
| 4 | **TMP Worldwide (now Radancy)** | London | 200+ | Global recruitment marketing agency. UK office manages 50+ employer brands. |
| 5 | **Tonic Agency** | London/Manchester | 30–50 | Creative recruitment marketing. Serve mid-market and enterprise UK employers. |

#### RPOs & Recruitment Consultancies (Manage hiring for dozens of clients)

| # | Company | HQ | Size | Why them |
|---|---------|-----|------|----------|
| 6 | **Cielo Talent** | UK office | 3,000+ global | Major RPO. If they adopt Rankwell for clients, instant scale. |
| 7 | **AMS (Alexander Mann Solutions)** | London | 4,500+ | Huge RPO. Employer brand is core service. First-mover incentive. |
| 8 | **Guidant Global** | London | 200+ | RPO and MSP. Employer brand consulting is growth area for them. |
| 9 | **Resource Solutions** | London | 3,000+ | Part of Robert Walters group. Major RPO with employer brand services. |
| 10 | **Omni RMS** | London/Sheffield | 100+ | UK RPO. Growing employer brand advisory practice. |

#### Mid-Market Employers (Direct £199/month customers)

| # | Company | HQ | Employees | Why them |
|---|---------|-----|-----------|----------|
| 11 | **Monzo** | London | 3,000+ | Tech-forward, strong employer brand, would understand the AI visibility problem instantly. |
| 12 | **Revolut** | London | 8,000+ | Aggressive hiring, known for culture issues — would want to control AI narrative. |
| 13 | **Gymshark** | Solihull | 1,000+ | Consumer brand that trades on culture. Would be horrified by AI hallucinations about them. |
| 14 | **Deliveroo** | London | 2,500+ | High-volume hiring, complex employer brand (riders vs. HQ). |
| 15 | **Octopus Energy** | London | 6,000+ | Fastest-growing energy company. Named best employer repeatedly. Would want AI to reflect this. |
| 16 | **Brewdog** | Ellon | 2,000+ | Controversial employer brand. AI probably says terrible things about them. Urgent need. |
| 17 | **PureGym** | Leeds | 5,000+ | High-volume hiring, multi-location. Invisible to AI. |
| 18 | **Starling Bank** | London | 3,000+ | Digital bank, competes with Monzo for talent. AI differentiation matters. |
| 19 | **JD Sports** | Bury | 60,000+ | Massive retail employer. AI narrative is critical for store-level hiring. |
| 20 | **Asos** | London | 2,400+ | Tech-first retailer. Strong employer brand team. Would get the AI angle immediately. |

### Budget Cycles & Who Signs Off

| Company Type | Budget Cycle | Decision Maker | Typical Approval Time |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------------------|
| EB Agencies | Rolling (client budgets) | MD or Client Director | 1–2 weeks |
| RPOs | Quarterly (client renewals) | Head of Solutions/Strategy | 2–4 weeks |
| Tech companies (500–5K) | Rolling | Head of TA or HR Director | 1–2 weeks under £5K |
| Enterprise (5K+) | Annual (Jan budget set) | VP Talent + Procurement | 4–12 weeks |
| Retail/Hospitality | Quarterly | HR Director | 2–4 weeks |

**Implication:** Agencies and mid-market tech companies can buy within days. Enterprise takes months. **Start with agencies and tech.**

## 2. COMPETITOR & PRICING ANALYSIS

### Direct Competitors (Who Else Audits Employer Brands?)

**The short answer: Nobody does what Rankwell does.** No tool currently shows companies what AI specifically says about them as employers. But several companies touch adjacent problems:

#### Tier 1: Traditional Employer Brand Research

| Competitor | What They Do | Pricing | Gap Rankwell Fills |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Universum** (Stepstone Group) | Annual employer attractiveness surveys. Ranks companies by student/professional perception. | £15K–£50K/year for custom research. Enterprise only. | Static annual data vs. Rankwell's real-time AI monitoring. No AI-specific insights. 12-month contracts. |
| **Randstad Employer Brand Research** | Annual survey of 6,000+ workers per country on employer perceptions. | Free report, but pay £10K+ for custom cuts and competitor data. | Measures human perception, not AI perception. Annual, not weekly. Can't action findings. |
| **Employer Brand Index (EBI)** by Link Humans | Ongoing social media monitoring for employer brand. Tracks 16 attributes across social channels. | £500–£2,000/month depending on scope. | Monitors social media, NOT AI responses. Doesn't track what ChatGPT/Perplexity/Claude say. |

#### Tier 2: Glassdoor & Review Platforms

| Competitor | What They Do | Pricing | Gap Rankwell Fills |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Glassdoor for Employers** | Profile management, review responses, analytics. | Free basic. Enhanced Profile: £5K–£15K/year. Job slots extra. | Glassdoor **blocks AI crawlers**. Managing your Glassdoor profile does nothing for AI visibility. And Glassdoor shows you reviews, not what AI says. |
| **Comparably** | Employee culture and compensation data. Awards and rankings. | Free employer profile. Premium: ~$5K/year. | Self-reported data. No AI monitoring. No structured data output. |
| **Kununu** (DACH markets) | Employer reviews for German-speaking markets. | Similar to Glassdoor pricing. | Regional only. Same AI-blocking issues. |

#### Tier 3: Adjacent HR Tech

| Competitor | What They Do | Pricing | Gap Rankwell Fills |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| **LinkedIn Talent Insights** | Labour market analytics, talent pool data, competitive intelligence. | £5K–£25K/year. Part of LinkedIn Recruiter suite. | LinkedIn blocks AI. Their "insights" are internal to LinkedIn. No AI monitoring. |
| **Beamery** | Talent CRM, sourcing, internal mobility. | Enterprise only. £50K+/year. | Completely different product. No AI monitoring. |
| **Phenom** | Talent experience platform, career sites, chatbots. | Enterprise. £30K+/year. | Better career sites, but no AI monitoring or structured data for LLMs. |
| **Teamtailor** | ATS with employer branding features, career sites. | Custom pricing, est. £200–£500/month. | Nice career pages but no JSON-LD, no AI monitoring. |

#### Tier 4: Emerging/Adjacent

| Competitor | What They Do | Pricing | Gap Rankwell Fills |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Otterly.ai** | AI search monitoring for brands (SEO focus). | $49–$399/month. | Monitors AI search results for marketing, not employment. Could pivot. Watch closely. |
| **Profound** | AI-powered brand tracking via LLM queries. | Early stage, $500+/month. | General brand monitoring. Not employer-specific. No employer data infrastructure. |
| **Peec AI** | Personal branding AI tool for LinkedIn. | $29/month. | Individual-focused, not employer. |

### What's Missing From Every Competitor's Offering

1. **None monitor what AI says about employers.** This is Rankwell's unique angle. Zero overlap.
2. **None provide structured data (JSON-LD) for AI readability.** Career pages are invisible to LLMs.
3. **None surface the "Shadow Salary" — the salary AI thinks a company pays.** This is our killer hook.
4. **None connect auditing to fixing.** Universum tells you your ranking. They can't help you change it.
5. **None have weekly cadence.** Traditional EB research is annual. AI changes weekly.

### Recommended Launch Pricing

Based on competitive analysis and ICP budget analysis:

| Tier | Price | Positioning | Target |
|------|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Free Audit** | £0 | Top of funnel. Shows the problem. | Everyone |
| **Starter** | £49/month | Basic monitoring (monthly reports, 1 company). | Freelancers, small companies (<100 employees) |
| **Pro** | £199/month | Full monitoring (weekly reports, unlimited roles, embed snippet, alerts, dashboard). | Mid-market employers, 500–5,000 employees |
| **Agency** | £99/month per client (min 10) | White-label, multi-client dashboard, bulk reporting. | EB agencies, RPOs |
| **Enterprise** | Custom (£500–£2,000/month) | SLA, SSO, dedicated support, custom integrations. | 5,000+ employees |

#### Why £199/month Is the Right Number

- **Below the "procurement line":** Most HR teams can expense £199/month on a credit card without procurement approval. This is critical for speed.
- **Above the "toy line":** £49/month feels like a toy to a Head of TA. £199/month feels like a real tool.
- **10x cheaper than alternatives:** Universum charges £15K+. Link Humans charges £500+/month for social monitoring alone. We're the modern, affordable option.
- **Agency arbitrage works:** Agency buys at £99/client, sells monitoring as part of a £500–£2K/month retainer. 5x–20x markup. They'll sell it hard.
- **Unit economics work:** At 99% gross margins (AI API costs are ~£1/employer/month), every £199 is almost pure contribution margin.

#### Freemium vs. Free Trial vs. Paid-Only?

**Answer: Free audit → Paid. No freemium tier for ongoing monitoring.**

| Model | Verdict | Reasoning |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Freemium** | ❌ No | Creates support burden. Free users who never convert. Devalues the product. |
| **Free trial (14 days)** | ⚠️ Maybe later | Good for self-serve at scale. But at launch we want high-touch conversion. |
| **Free audit + Paid** | ✅ Yes | The audit proves the problem for free. That's enough. When they want to fix it, they pay. Clean, simple. |

The free audit is the hook. It creates urgency by showing the problem. The fix requires payment. No ongoing free tier.

**Exception:** The Starter tier at £49/month serves the "I can't afford £199 but I'm interested" segment. It's limited enough to push upgrades but generates revenue from Day 1.

#### Common Objections & Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We already manage our Glassdoor" | "Glassdoor blocks AI from reading that data. Literally. Here's their robots.txt. Your Glassdoor profile is invisible to ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity." |
| "AI isn't that important for hiring yet" | "40% of job searches now involve AI. This isn't future — it's happening. Want me to show you what ChatGPT says about you right now?" |
| "We have an employer brand agency" | "Perfect. We work alongside agencies. We monitor the AI layer they can't see. Ask them what ChatGPT says about you — they won't know." |
| "£199/month seems expensive" | "You're spending £X on Glassdoor and £Y on LinkedIn. Both block AI. This is the only tool that makes you visible where candidates actually look now." |
| "Can't we just add JSON-LD ourselves?" | "You could add schema markup, sure. But can you monitor what 4 different AI models say about you weekly? Can you detect hallucinated salaries? Can you benchmark against competitors? The monitoring is the product." |
| "I need to get budget approved" | "Under £2,400/year? Most HR teams can expense this. If you need a business case, I'll send you a one-pager showing the cost of one bad hire from salary misinformation." |

#### Week 4 Targets

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Cumulative free audits | 1,000 |
| Paying customers (cumulative) | 100 |
| Agency partners (cumulative) | 3–5 |

| Direct paying customers | 20–40 |
| ATS partnership conversations | 5 |
| MRR | £15,000–£20,000 |
| Benchmark report downloads | 500 |

## 4. CHANNEL STRATEGY

### LinkedIn (Primary Channel — 60% of early customers will come from here)

#### Why LinkedIn Wins

The ICP lives on LinkedIn. Employer Brand Managers, Heads of TA, HR Directors, agency MDs — they're all active daily. HR is the most LinkedIn-native function in business.

#### Posting Strategy

**Frequency:** 5x/week (weekdays, 8:30 AM GMT)

**Content pillars (rotate):**

| Day | Pillar | Example Post |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| Monday | **Data reveal** | "I audited [Company]'s AI employer brand. Here's what ChatGPT told candidates about their salaries..." |
| Tuesday | **Industry insight** | "The top 3 employer review sites all block AI from their data. Here's what that means for you." |
| Wednesday | **How-to/tip** | "3 things you can do today to make your careers page visible to AI (takes 10 minutes)" |
| Thursday | **Controversy/hot take** | "Employer brand teams are spending £100K/year on channels AI can't read. Time to reallocate." |
| Friday | **Case study/result** | "Before Rankwell: ChatGPT said [Company] pays £45K for senior devs. Reality: £75K. Here's how we fixed it." |

**Post format that works for HR LinkedIn:**
- Short paragraphs (1–2 lines max)
- First line = hook (question or surprising stat)
- Use line breaks aggressively
- End with a question to drive comments
- No hashtags except 1–2 niche ones (#employerbrand #talentattraction)
- Include relevant image/screenshot (audit result, robots.txt, comparison chart)

#### DM Strategy

**Target:** 30 new connections/day. 10 DMs/day to warm connections.

**Connection request message (100 characters):**
> Hi [Name] — I'm building a tool that shows what AI says about employers. Thought you'd find it relevant.

**Follow-up DM (after connection accepted):**
> Thanks for connecting! I ran a quick audit of [Company]'s AI employer brand — ChatGPT has some interesting things to say about your salary data. Want me to send you the full report? No strings attached.

**After they reply yes:**
> Here's the report [link/PDF]. The Shadow Salary gap jumped out at me — AI thinks you pay [£X] for [role] when the market rate is [£Y]. Happy to walk you through it if useful. 15 minutes?

### Cold Email (Secondary Channel — 25% of early customers)

**Volume:** Start at 20/day Week 1. Scale to 50/day by Week 3.

**Key principle:** Every cold email includes the recipient's actual audit data. This is the cheat code. We're not selling a concept — we're showing them their own problem.

**Tools needed:**
- Email: Custom domain (e.g., hello@rankwell.ai)
- Finding emails: Hunter.io, Apollo.io, or LinkedIn Sales Navigator
- Sending: Instantly.ai or Smartlead (for deliverability and sequences)
- CRM: Simple spreadsheet initially, then HubSpot free

**Full templates in Section 7.**

## 5. GROWTH LOOPS

### Loop 1: The Audit Flywheel

```
Company runs free audit
  → Shocked by results
    → Shares on LinkedIn ("Look what AI says about us!")
      → Their network sees post
        → Runs their own audit
          → Repeat
```

**Mechanics:**
- Make audit results shareable with one click (social sharing buttons)
- Include a "Share your AI Employer Brand Score" badge/card
- Each shared audit links back to rankwell.ai to run your own
- **Expected viral coefficient: 0.3** (every 10 audits generate 3 more from sharing)

### Loop 2: The Competitor Trigger

```
Company A signs up for Rankwell
  → Sees competitor data ("Company B has a better AI employer brand score")
    → Company B finds out (because Company A mentions it, or we tell them)
      → Company B runs audit
        → Company B signs up to beat Company A
          → Repeat
```

**Mechanics:**
- Every audit report includes competitor comparison
- "How you compare to other [industry] employers in AI visibility"
- When auditing a company, also audit their top 3 competitors
- Send: "Your competitor [X] now has an AI employer brand score of 85. You're at 42."

### Loop 3: The Agency Multiplier

```
Agency signs up (£99/client × 20 clients)
  → Agency wins new pitch using Rankwell data
    → New client gets onboarded to Rankwell
      → Agency grows revenue, signs more clients
        → More Rankwell licenses
          → Repeat
```

**Mechanics:**
- Give agencies a "pitch kit" — audit templates they can run for prospects
- Agency can run unlimited free audits for business development
- Every new agency client = new Rankwell subscriber automatically
- **Expected multiplier: Each agency adds 5–10 new clients per quarter**

### Loop 4: The Verify Page as a Growth Lever

```
Employer creates verified Rankwell profile
  → Adds "Verified by Rankwell" badge to careers page
    → Candidates see badge, click through to rankwell.ai
      → Candidate shares with their current employer
        → Current employer runs audit
          → Signs up
```

**Mechanics:**
- "Verified by Rankwell ✓" badge for careers pages (like SSL certificates for employer data)
- Badge links to the employer's Rankwell verify page
- Verify page shows: salary data verified ✓, benefits confirmed ✓, culture data accurate ✓
- Social proof: "This employer's data has been verified by Rankwell"
- **Candidates become the sales force.** When they see inaccurate AI data about a prospective employer, they can check Rankwell for verified information.

### Loop 5: The Benchmark Report Lead Magnet

```
Publish "UK AI Employer Brand Index 2026"
  → Companies download to see their ranking
    → Companies not in report request inclusion
      → Run their audit (free)
        → Convert to paid
          → Contribute data for next quarter's report
            → Report gets bigger, more valuable
              → More downloads
                → Repeat
```

**Mechanics:**
- Quarterly benchmark reports by industry and company size
- Gated with email (lead capture)
- Include 100 companies. Rank all of them.
- Companies ranked poorly → immediate sales opportunity
- Companies ranked well → want to maintain position (retention)
- Press picks up the ranking → free distribution
- **Expected: 500+ downloads per report, 50+ qualified leads per report**

### Loop 6: The Monday Morning Email

```
Customer receives weekly monitoring email
  → Forwards to colleague/boss ("Look at this!")
    → Boss shares in leadership meeting
      → Leadership asks "What's Rankwell?"
        → Internal champion strengthens
          → Churn reduces to near-zero
            → Renewals + upgrades
```

**Mechanics:**
- Weekly email: dead simple, one-page digest
- Designed to be forwarded (clear, self-contained, no login needed to understand)
- Include "forward this to your team" CTA
- Track email forwarding rates
- When emails get forwarded 3+ times → trigger enterprise upsell conversation

## 6. REVENUE MODEL TO 1,000 CUSTOMERS

### Unit Economics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Average Revenue Per Account (ARPA)** | £165/month | Blended: 60% Pro at £199, 30% Agency at £99, 10% Starter at £49 |
| **Gross Margin** | 97% | AI API costs ~£1/employer/month. Hosting ~£0.50. |
| **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** | £150 (direct) / £30 (agency) | Direct: founder time + tools. Agency: revenue share only. |
| **Blended CAC** | £85 | Assuming 40% via agencies, 60% direct |
| **Lifetime Value (LTV)** | £3,564 | £165/month × 90% monthly retention × ~21.6 month avg lifetime |
| **LTV:CAC Ratio** | 42:1 | Exceptional. Driven by near-zero COGS and product-led growth. |
| **Payback Period** | <1 month | CAC recovered in first month's payment |
| **Monthly Churn** | ~5% (target: 3%) | Monitoring creates habit → low churn. Monday emails = retention. |
| **Net Revenue Retention** | 110%+ (target) | Agencies add clients. Pro upgrades to Enterprise. Starter to Pro. |

**Costs include:** Hosting (~£200/month), AI APIs (~£500/month at 1K customers), email tools (~£200/month), domain/SSL, sales tools. Grows to include freelancers/contractors.

**This business is profitable from Month 1.** No fundraising required.

### When to Hire & What to Hire First

| Milestone | Hire | Role | Cost | Why |
|-----------|------|------|------|-----|
| **50 customers** | Customer Success (part-time/freelance) | Onboard customers, manage agency relationships | £2K/month | Free up founder for sales & product |
| **200 customers** | Content Marketer (freelance) | Blog posts, LinkedIn content, benchmark reports | £3K/month | Content compounds. Founder can't do everything. |
| **500 customers** | Full-time SDR/BDR | Outbound prospecting, demo booking | £35K/year + commission | Pipeline generation becomes the bottleneck |
| **500 customers** | Part-time developer (contractor) | Product improvements, integrations, automation | £4K/month | ATS integrations, agency dashboard features |
| **750 customers** | Account Manager | Manage agency relationships, enterprise upsell | £40K/year + commission | Agencies need hand-holding. Enterprise needs attention. |
| **1,000 customers** | Head of Growth / Marketing | Own entire demand gen engine | £65K/year | Founder needs to shift to product & partnerships |

**Key insight:** Hire contractors first, convert to full-time when you have proof of the role's value. The agency model means you can scale revenue without scaling headcount proportionally (one agency relationship = 20–100 customers).

## 7. COLD EMAIL TEMPLATES

### Template 1: For Employer Brand Managers / Heads of Talent Attraction

**Subject line options (A/B test):**
- "What ChatGPT tells candidates about [Company]"
- "[Company]'s AI employer brand — you should see this"
- "Your Shadow Salary gap is [X]%"

```
Hi [First Name],

I ran an AI employer brand audit on [Company] — basically asked ChatGPT, 
Claude, and Perplexity what it's like to work there.

The results were interesting:

• ChatGPT thinks your Senior [Role] pays £[X]. (Is that right?)
• Perplexity describes your culture as "[AI quote]"  
• Your careers page has zero structured data — AI literally can't read it

Quick context: Glassdoor, Indeed, and LinkedIn all block AI from reading 
their data. So AI makes things up. We call it the "Shadow Salary" — 
the number AI thinks you pay, which may be completely wrong.

I've attached your full report. No strings, it's genuinely useful.

If fixing this matters (it probably should — 40% of job searches now 
involve AI), I'm happy to show you what Rankwell does in 15 minutes.

Best,
[Name]
```

### Template 2: For Agency MDs / Client Directors

**Subject line options:**
- "New service line for [Agency] — takes 10 minutes to set up"
- "Your clients are asking about AI. Here's the answer."
- "How [Agency] can charge £500/month for something that costs £99"

```
Hi [First Name],

Quick question: when your clients ask "what does ChatGPT say about us 
as an employer?" — what do you tell them?

Because they're about to start asking. 40% of job searches now involve 
AI, and every major employer data source (Glassdoor, Indeed, LinkedIn) 
blocks AI from their data.

I built Rankwell — it monitors what AI says about employers weekly. 
Shadow salaries, culture hallucinations, visibility gaps. The whole picture.

The agency model: £99/client/month. You white-label it, charge your 
clients £500–2,000 as part of your retainer. New revenue line, zero 
development cost.

I've already run audits on 3 of your clients:
• [Client 1]: Shadow Salary gap of [X]%
• [Client 2]: AI says "[concerning quote about culture]"
• [Client 3]: Zero AI visibility — doesn't appear in any AI response

Want me to walk you through it? 15 minutes, I'll show you how [Agency] 
can offer AI employer brand monitoring by next week.

[Calendar link]

Best,
[Name]
```

### Template 3: For HR Directors / VPs People (High-Growth Tech)

**Subject line options:**
- "What AI tells your candidates before they even apply"
- "[Company] vs [Competitor] — the AI employer brand gap"
- "You're spending £[X] on employer brand. AI tells a different story."

```
Hi [First Name],

Candidates are asking AI about [Company] before they apply. 
Here's what they hear:

"[Direct quote from ChatGPT about the company — usually contains 
inaccuracies or outdated info]"

The problem: Glassdoor, Indeed, and LinkedIn block AI from their data. 
So AI pieces together your employer brand from scraps — old articles, 
Reddit threads, stale Glassdoor reviews.

I built Rankwell to fix this. We show you exactly what every major AI 
says about you as an employer, flag the inaccuracies, and give you a 
verified data profile that AI can actually read.

£199/month. Cancel anytime. 

Here's your full audit report: [link]

Worth 15 minutes to see the full picture?

Best,
[Name]
```

### Follow-Up Sequence (for all templates)

**Day 3 (if no reply):**
```
Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up on the AI employer brand audit I sent over.

One thing I wanted to flag: [Specific competitor] has a stronger AI 
employer brand than [Company] right now. Candidates asking AI to 
compare you will see [Competitor] recommended first.

Happy to show you the comparison.

[Name]
```

**Day 7 (if no reply):**
```
Hi [First Name],

Last note on this — I ran an updated audit and your Shadow Salary 
gap actually widened this week. AI is now quoting [specific number] 
for [role], which is [X]% off.

If you want to see the full competitive picture, the report is still 
available here: [link]

No hard feelings if the timing isn't right. 

[Name]
```

**Day 14 (breakup email):**
```
Hi [First Name],

Closing the loop on this. If AI employer brand visibility isn't a 
priority right now, totally understand.

One thing before I go: I'm publishing "The UK AI Employer Brand Index" 
next month — ranking 100 companies by their AI employer brand strength. 
[Company] will be included.

If you'd like to verify your data before publication (so the ranking 
is based on facts, not AI guesses), just reply and I'll set it up.

Best,
[Name]
```

**Monthly Monitoring Reports Sent**

This single metric captures:
- Active paying customers (each gets weekly reports)
- Engagement (are they opening them?)
- Retention (still subscribed = still getting reports)
- Growth (more reports = more customers)

Target: 400 reports/month by end of Month 1 (100 customers × 4 weekly reports).

## APPENDIX B: DEMO SCRIPT (15 MINUTES)

### Opening (2 min)
> "Thanks for taking 15 minutes. Quick context: I ran an AI employer brand audit on [Company] before this call. I'm going to show you exactly what ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity tell candidates about working at [Company]. Ready?"

### The Problem (3 min)
- Share screen. Open ChatGPT.
- Type: "What's it like to work at [Company]? What do they pay senior developers?"
- Let the AI respond live. Watch their reaction.
- Highlight inaccuracies: "See that salary figure? Is that right?"
- Show Perplexity response. Show Claude response.
- "This is what 40% of your candidates see before they even visit your careers page."

### The Bigger Problem (2 min)
- Show the robots.txt research:
  - "Glassdoor blocks AI. See this line? 'Disallow: /Reviews'"
  - "Indeed blocks AI. LinkedIn blocks AI."
  - "The three biggest sources of employer data have locked AI out. So AI makes things up."
- "Your careers page has no structured data. AI can't read it either."
- "You're essentially invisible and uncontrolled."

### The Solution (3 min)
- Show their Rankwell dashboard (or mock-up):
  - Shadow Salary Gap: X%
  - AI Accuracy Score: X/100
  - Competitor Comparison: "Here's how [Competitor] compares"
- "Rankwell monitors all major AI models weekly. You get a Monday morning email."
- Show the verified profile page
- "When you verify your data, AI starts finding it. Your Shadow Salary gap closes."

### The Competitor Hook (2 min)
- "I also audited [their biggest competitor for talent]."
- Show side-by-side comparison.
- "They're [ahead/behind] you in AI visibility. Here's why..."
- This creates urgency — nobody wants to lose to a competitor.

### The Close (3 min)
> "It's £199/month. Cancel anytime. Takes 10 minutes to set up. You verify your data, we start monitoring. First Monday morning email arrives next week."
> 
> "Given what you've seen — that AI is telling your candidates wrong salary data and your Glassdoor profile is invisible to AI — does it make sense to fix this?"

**If yes:** "Great. I'll send you the payment link now and we can set up your profile together on this call."

**If "need to think":** "Totally understand. One thing — your Shadow Salary gap changes weekly. Every week without verified data is another week candidates get the wrong information. Can I follow up Friday?"

**If "need budget approval":** "The annual cost is £2,388. Under most HR team discretionary budgets. I'll send a one-pager business case you can forward to your manager — includes ROI calculation based on cost-per-hire impact."

*The unfair advantage: **nobody else is doing this.** The category doesn't exist yet. Rankwell creates it.*
