## Landscape Summary

The "AI employer brand visibility" category is forming right now. There are exactly 5 players, each attacking a different segment. Nobody owns UK mid-market yet. That's our gap.

| **PerceptionX** | TA/EB leaders | US-centric | Visibility Index | "Book a Demo" | Pre-seed/seed (est.) |
| **Built In** | Tech employers | US-only, tech-only | Free reputation report | Enterprise SaaS | Established (hundreds of staff) |
| **Visiblie** | B2B marketing + HR | Europe (Netherlands HQ) | Calendly booking | Custom | Early stage |
| **OpenRole** | TA/HR/EB mid-market | UK-first | Free instant audit | £49/£149/£399/mo | Pre-revenue |

## Detailed Competitor Profiles

### 1. Profound (tryprofound.com)

**What they do:** AI brand visibility platform. Monitor how your brand appears in AI search and agent conversations. Optimise content to increase AI citations.

**Who they sell to:** CMOs and brand marketers at enterprises. NOT employer brand — general brand visibility. But the mechanism is identical to what we do for employer brands.

**Key numbers:**
- 1B+ citations analysed daily
- 30B+ crawler visits analysed daily
- 10M+ prompts analysed daily
- Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins backed ($35M+ raised)

**Products:**
- Answer Engine Insights — monitor AI mentions
- Agent Analytics — track AI agent interactions with your brand
- Prompt Volumes — see what people ask AI about you
- Shopping — AI product recommendations tracking
- Agents — create AI agents for your brand
- Profound Index — public brand AI visibility rankings

**Case studies (validated — these are real):**
- 1840&Co: 0% → 11% AI visibility from ONE blog post in 2 weeks
- Ramp: 3.2% → 22.2% from website copy rewrite
- Statsig: 24.2% → 46.5% in one month
- Opus Clip: 20% more AI traffic, 37% more signups

**Pricing:** Enterprise only. No published pricing. "Contact Sales." Estimated $10K-50K/month based on stage and fundraising.

**Strengths:**
- Massive data infrastructure (billions of data points)
- Sequoia backing validates the thesis
- Strong case studies with real numbers
- Profound Index gives them a public distribution channel

**Weaknesses:**
- Enterprise-only = long sales cycles
- Not focused on employer brand at all (general marketing)
- No self-serve, no free tool
- No UK focus
- Pricing excludes mid-market entirely

**What we steal:** Their case study data is our best proof point. Reference their numbers in our sales conversations. "Profound proved the mechanism works — we apply it specifically to employer brands."

### 2. PerceptionX (perceptionx.ai)

**What they do:** "Build a reputation that recruits for you." AI-native employer reputation measurement and strategy. Monitor how AI describes you as an employer.

**Who they sell to:** TA leaders and Employer Brand managers.

**Key claims:**
- 80% of job seekers use ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini to research companies
- 90% of US jobseekers say AI is useful in job search
- 1,300% surge in AI-driven traffic to career websites in last 6 months

**Products:**
- Employer Perception Score — blends visibility + sentiment + relevance + proof points
- Visibility Index — monthly public ranking by industry (15 themes)
- Competitive benchmarking
- Theme-level analysis across 18 employer brand themes

**Their 18 themes:**
Application Process, Candidate Communication, Candidate Experience, Candidate Feedback, Career Opportunities, Company Culture, Compensation, General Business, Social Impact, Inclusion, Innovation, Interview Experience, Leadership, Mission & Purpose, Onboarding, Rewards & Recognition, Security & Perks, Wellbeing & Balance

**Visibility Index methodology:**
1. Track real candidate questions
2. Map to employer brand themes
3. Multi-model evaluation (reduce bias)
4. Calculate visibility benchmark
5. Monthly recalculation

**Founders:**
- Andy Partridge — 15+ years candidate/employee experience, 8 years Fortune 500 employer reputation
- Karim Al Ansari — Employer brand index developer, lead strategist for Fortune 500s, 8+ years products

**Pricing:** "Book a Demo." No published pricing. Likely enterprise.

**Strengths:**
- Direct competitor — same buyer (TA/EB), same thesis
- Strong founder expertise in employer brand measurement
- Visibility Index is a smart distribution play (like G2 rankings)
- Sophisticated methodology (18 themes)
- Good messaging: "See what candidates see"

**Weaknesses:**
- No self-serve, no instant audit (gated behind demo)
- No published pricing
- US-centric
- 18 themes is arguably too many — dilutes actionability
- No free tool for lead gen
- No content playbook (diagnosis without treatment)
- "Book a Demo" gate = slow growth

**What we steal:** Their Visibility Index concept is excellent. We already have our UK Index. We should ensure ours is more actionable — show specific gaps, not just rankings. Their 18 themes are fluffy; our 8 factual categories (salary, benefits, interview, etc.) are more actionable.

### 3. Built In (employers.builtin.com)

**What they do:** Pivoted from tech job board to "AI-powered recruitment platform." Now offers AI Employer Intelligence with a free reputation report.

**Who they sell to:** Tech employers in the US. Large companies with TA budgets.

**Products:**
- Free AI Reputation Score (same hook as OpenRole!)
- AI Employer Intelligence platform
- Job posting + recruitment solutions
- Content marketing for employer brands

**Free report funnel:** Enter your company → get an AI reputation score. Similar to our free audit but limited to tech companies and US market.

**Pricing:** Enterprise only. "Contact Sales" for memberships. Job slots available separately. Estimated $20K-60K/year based on company size.

**Strengths:**
- Huge existing audience (millions of tech professionals)
- Brand recognition in US tech
- Free reputation report validates our approach
- Content engine drives massive organic traffic
- Established revenue from job board

**Weaknesses:**
- US-only, tech-only
- Enterprise pricing excludes most employers
- Pivoting from job board = split focus
- Free report likely shallow compared to ours (they're a job board, not an analytics company)
- No UK presence at all

**What we steal:** Their free report funnel concept. We already have this but should study their UX and copy. Also their content strategy — they publish "Best Places to Work" lists which drive massive traffic and backlinks.

### 4. Visiblie (visiblie.com)

**What they do:** AI visibility platform originally for B2B marketing, now expanding to employer branding.

**Who they sell to:** B2B growth teams, starting to target HR.

**Key messaging:**
- "The New Glassdoor: Candidates Trust AI More Than Recruiters"
- "Before they apply, they prompt"
- Cover 6 key candidate questions: salary, work-life balance, growth, interview, stability, remote policy

**Claims:**
- "73% of B2B buyers consult AI before speaking to sales"
- 39% rise in inbound leads case study (Flexy)
- Changes to AI citations can appear in days for RAG-based models (Perplexity, SearchGPT)

**LinkedIn/Microsoft angle:** They're positioning around the ChatGPT-LinkedIn integration. "Your AI Employer Brand will appear alongside your job postings." This is a smart angle we should also use.

**Pricing:** "Book a Demo" via Calendly (30 min). No published pricing.

**Strengths:**
- European base (Netherlands) — closer to UK market
- Smart positioning around LinkedIn/Microsoft integration
- Already addressing the 6 key employer brand questions
- Moving fast into the employer brand space
- Practical messaging ("we can't hide bad reviews, but we can dilute them")

**Weaknesses:**
- Originally a B2B marketing tool — employer brand is a bolt-on
- No instant audit or free tool
- No published pricing
- Small team, early stage
- Case studies are from marketing, not employer brand
- "Diluting bad reviews" messaging feels manipulative

**What we steal:** Their LinkedIn/Microsoft integration angle is compelling and underused in our messaging. We should add: "Microsoft is integrating ChatGPT into LinkedIn. Your AI employer brand will appear alongside your job postings. Are you ready?"

## OpenRole's Competitive Advantages

### 1. Instant Self-Serve Audit (No Demo, No Signup)
Every competitor gates their product behind "Book a Demo." We don't. This is our single biggest differentiator for top-of-funnel growth. A HR Director can run an audit in 30 seconds during a meeting and see results immediately.

### 2. Published Pricing
£49/£149/£399. Nobody else publishes pricing. This signals confidence, reduces friction, and respects the buyer's time. Mid-market HR leaders don't want to "book a demo" to find out if they can afford it.

### 3. UK-First
Every competitor is US-centric. We're the only player focused on UK employers. With 5.5M UK businesses and ~250K with 50+ employees, this is a massive addressable market with zero competition.

### 4. Actionable Playbooks (Not Just Diagnosis)
PerceptionX tells you "your culture visibility is 62%." We tell you "AI says you pay £55K. You actually pay £75K. Here's the paragraph to add to your careers page this week." Specific, actionable, measurable.

### 5. Information Gap Focus
We're not trying to measure 18 fuzzy themes. We focus on the factual questions candidates ask: salary, benefits, interview process, remote policy, tech stack. These are binary — either AI has the answer or it doesn't.

## Threats to Watch

1. **Glassdoor adding AI features** — If Glassdoor builds its own "what does AI say about you" tool, they have the data and the audience. Mitigation: Move fast, establish brand, build relationships before incumbents react.

2. **LinkedIn's AI integration** — Microsoft/LinkedIn could build this natively. But they'd serve their own data, not audit third-party AI models. Different value prop.

3. **Profound moving into employer brand** — With $35M+ and the infrastructure, they could add employer brand as a vertical. Mitigation: They're focused on CMOs, not HR. Different buyer.

4. **PerceptionX expanding to UK** — Most direct threat. If they launch in the UK with published pricing and a free tool, we lose our positioning advantage. Mitigation: Move fast. Get 100 UK employers on the platform before they expand.

## Messaging Ammunition

### Against PerceptionX:
"PerceptionX gives you a Perception Score with 18 themes. We show you the exact AI response candidates receive — word for word — and tell you what's wrong. Try our free audit in 30 seconds vs their demo booking."

### Against Built In:
"Built In is US-only and tech-only. If you're a UK employer outside Silicon Valley's orbit, they can't help. We built OpenRole for the 250,000 UK employers who need this."

### Against Visiblie:
"Visiblie started as a B2B marketing tool. Employer brand is a bolt-on for them. For us, it's the entire product. Every feature, every metric, every recommendation is designed for TA and employer brand teams."

### Against Profound:
"Profound is excellent for CMOs at enterprise scale — their data proves the mechanism works. We apply that same mechanism specifically to employer brands, at a price point mid-market teams can actually afford."

## Strategic Recommendations

1. **Ship fast.** We have a 6-12 month window before PerceptionX expands to UK or Profound adds employer brand. Every month counts.

2. **Own the UK Index.** PerceptionX has a US Visibility Index. We should own the UK equivalent. Monthly reports, industry rankings, press coverage. This becomes our moat.

3. **Publish the case studies.** Run the validation, get results, publish case studies immediately. Real numbers from real UK employers. Nobody has UK-specific data yet.

4. **LinkedIn/Microsoft angle.** Add this to our messaging immediately. It's a powerful urgency driver: "ChatGPT is being integrated into LinkedIn. When a candidate views your job posting, AI will describe your company next to it. Are you ready?"

5. **Stay self-serve.** Our instant audit and published pricing are massive competitive advantages. Never gate the free audit behind a signup. Never hide pricing. This is what makes us accessible where competitors aren't.
