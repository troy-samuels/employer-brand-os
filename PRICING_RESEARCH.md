# OpenRole Pricing Research & Recommendation

**Date:** 23 February 2026
**Author:** Malcolm
**Purpose:** Data-backed pricing strategy for OpenRole's AI Employer Visibility platform

---

## 1. Competitor Pricing Landscape

### Direct Competitors (AI + Employer Brand)

| Company | Target Market | Pricing | Model | Notes |
|---------|--------------|---------|-------|-------|
| **Built In** | US tech companies, enterprise | ~$20-60K/year (custom quotes) | Sales-led, annual contracts | 1,800+ customers. "Premium Partnership" = unlimited promoted jobs + employer profile + branded content. No self-serve pricing. Job slots are free but basic. |
| **Visiblie** | SMBs → Enterprise (employer brand AI monitoring) | €60/mo Starter → €103/mo Growth → Custom Enterprise | Self-serve + sales | Starter: 1 AI model (ChatGPT), 30 prompts/week, 1 language. Growth: 4 AI models, 100 prompts/week. Annual billing shown (monthly: €75 Starter, €129 Growth). |
| **PerceptionX** | Unknown (early stage) | No public pricing found | Unknown | Limited traction, primarily a benchmarking index |

### Adjacent Competitors (AI Visibility, General Brand)

| Company | Target Market | Pricing | Model | Notes |
|---------|--------------|---------|-------|-------|
| **OtterlyAI** | SMBs → Enterprise (general AI brand monitoring) | $29/mo Lite → $189/mo Standard → $489/mo Premium | Self-serve | Lite: 15 prompts, 4 AI engines. Standard: 100 prompts. Premium: 400 prompts. Add-ons: extra prompts $99/100, extra AI engines $9-149/mo each. Agency pricing available. |
| **AIclicks** | SMBs → agencies (AI SEO) | No public pricing page (redirects to demo/audit flow) | Audit-led, likely custom | "Done-for-you" positioning suggests services pricing, not pure SaaS |
| **SE Ranking** (AI toolkit) | Agencies → enterprise (SEO + AI search) | £76/mo Core → £167/mo Growth → Custom Enterprise | Self-serve + sales | AI visibility is bundled into broader SEO platform. 100-250 AI prompts/day tracked. Not employer-specific. |

### Incumbent HR Tools (What ICP Already Pays)

| Tool | Typical Annual Spend | What They Get |
|------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Glassdoor Enhanced Profile** | £5,000-15,000/year | Review responses, branded profile, analytics. NO AI-specific features. |
| **LinkedIn Recruiter** | £8,000-15,000/seat/year | Candidate sourcing, InMails, talent insights. NO employer narrative control. |
| **Indeed Sponsored Jobs** | £3,000-20,000/year | Job distribution. NO employer brand management. |
| **Employer brand agency** | £15,000-50,000/project | EVP development, careers page, content. One-off, no monitoring. |

---

## 2. ICP Budget Analysis

### Who's the buyer?

**Primary:** Head of Talent / HR Director at UK companies with 100-2,000 employees
**Secondary:** Employer Brand Manager / People & Culture lead
**Budget holder:** VP Talent or CHRO (budget approval), CFO (for anything >£5K/year)

### What budgets do they control?

| Budget Line | Typical Range (UK mid-market) | Decision Process |
|-------------|-------------------------------|------------------|
| Employer branding | £10K-50K/year | HR Director discretion up to ~£5K, VP/CFO above |
| Recruitment marketing | £20K-100K/year | Shared HR + Marketing |
| HR tech stack | £50K-200K/year | Procurement process for >£10K |
| Training & development | £500-1,500/employee/year | L&D budget, not relevant |

### Key insight: The "credit card" threshold

- **Under £200/month (£2,400/year):** HR Director can expense on a corporate card or approve from departmental budget without escalation. This is the impulse-buy zone for HR tech.
- **£200-500/month (£2,400-6,000/year):** Needs VP Talent or line manager approval. Usually a brief business case or email justification.
- **Over £500/month (£6,000+/year):** Procurement territory. Multiple stakeholders, longer sales cycles, sometimes competitive tender.

**OpenRole's sweet spot = under £200/month for Growth.** The HR Director finds the audit, gets shocked, and can approve the spend without a board meeting. The PDF briefing is for when they need to escalate.

## 3. Pricing Psychology Frameworks

### 3.1 The Decoy Effect (Asymmetric Dominance)

Current pricing: £49 / £149 / £399

The Growth tier (£149) should be the obvious choice. To make it irresistible:
- Starter must feel *too limited* — creates urgency to upgrade
- Scale must feel *impressive but overkill* for most — makes Growth the "smart" pick
- The jump from £49 → £149 (3x) should feel like 10x more value

**Current assessment:** The jump from Starter (3 models, monthly, top 5 gaps) to Growth (4 models, weekly, full playbook, hallucination alerts, competitors) IS a significant value jump. Good.

### 3.2 Anchoring Against Alternatives

**The anchor isn't your cheapest tier — it's what they're already spending.**

| Alternative | Cost | What they get | OpenRole comparison |
|-------------|------|---------------|---------------------|
| Glassdoor Enhanced | £5-15K/year | Review management for ONE platform | OpenRole covers ALL AI models for £1,788/year |
| LinkedIn Recruiter | £8-15K/year | Sourcing, not reputation | OpenRole fixes *why* candidates don't apply |
| Brand agency | £15-50K/project | One-off, no monitoring | OpenRole monitors continuously for £1,788/year |
| Doing nothing | £30K+ per bad hire | Unfilled roles, wrong-fit candidates | OpenRole costs less than ONE hiring mistake |

**Recommendation:** The pricing page should show this comparison explicitly. Not "our plans" but "what you're spending vs. what you could spend."

### 3.3 Price-to-Value Ratio

The critical metric isn't what the tool costs — it's the cost of the problem it solves.

- Average cost-per-hire in UK: £3,000-4,000 (CIPD)
- Average cost of a bad hire: £12,000-30,000 (depending on seniority)
- Average time-to-fill UK: 27-36 days
- Cost of an unfilled role: ~£4,700/month in lost productivity

**At £149/month, OpenRole needs to save ONE hire per year to deliver 16x ROI.** That's an easy sell.

### 3.4 The "Free → Paid" Conversion Psychology

The free audit is the hook. But the conversion from free → paid needs a clear trigger:

**Current trigger:** "Your score is X/100. Here's what's wrong."
**Missing trigger:** "Here's what it's costing you RIGHT NOW."

The PDF briefing we just built addresses this — the "Estimated Cost of Inaction" section quantifies the pain. But the pricing page needs the same treatment.

## 4. Pricing Architecture Analysis

### What Works in Current Pricing

✅ **Free tier as lead gen** — no signup, no friction. Shock value drives conversion.
✅ **Growth as the hero tier** — starred, best value-for-money positioning
✅ **Company-size segmentation** — naturally limits which tier feels right
✅ **ROI anchor in thesis** — "one saved hire pays for 17 years"
✅ **Significantly cheaper than incumbents** — easy budget justification

### What Needs Improvement

#### Problem 1: Starter is too generous for £49

At £49/month, Starter includes:
- 3 AI models
- Monthly gap report
- Content templates (top 5 gaps)
- Monthly snapshot

**Risk:** Companies with <50 employees might never need Growth. They get enough to act on and churn before upgrading. The Starter tier should create value but leave them wanting more.

**Fix:** Make Starter a "diagnostic" tier — they can SEE the problem but need Growth to get the playbook.

#### Problem 2: No annual discount incentive

No mention of annual billing. SaaS standard is 15-20% discount for annual commitment.

- Monthly: £149/mo = £1,788/year
- Annual: £125/mo = £1,500/year (16% saving)

Annual billing dramatically improves cash flow, reduces churn, and gives you runway.

#### Problem 3: Scale tier value gap

£399/month is a big jump from £149. The main additions are:
- 6 AI models (vs 4)
- Unlimited locations + competitors
- Done-for-you content drafts
- Priority support

"Done-for-you content drafts" is a services commitment that's hard to scale. This tier needs to be productised or repositioned as a "managed" tier with clear scope limits.

#### Problem 4: No "monthly cost per employee" framing

For HR budgets, cost-per-employee is the universal metric:
- Growth at £149/mo for 51-500 employees = £0.30-2.92/employee/month
- That's less than a cup of coffee per employee per month

This framing should be on the pricing page.

## 5. Revised Pricing Recommendation

### Recommended Pricing Structure

| Plan | Monthly | Annual (per month) | Target | Purpose |
|------|---------|-------------------|--------|---------|
| **Free** | £0 | — | Anyone | Unlimited audits. See the problem. No signup. |
| **Starter** | £59/mo | £49/mo | 1-100 employees | Diagnostic: see what AI says, monthly report, top 3 gap alerts. NO playbook. |
| **Growth** ⭐ | £179/mo | £149/mo | 100-1,000 employees | Full solution: weekly reports, complete gap analysis + content playbook, hallucination alerts, 3 competitor benchmarks, Slack/email notifications |
| **Scale** | £449/mo | £379/mo | 1,000+ employees | Everything in Growth + unlimited competitors, multi-location, API access, custom branded reports, quarterly strategy review call |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom | 2,000+ / multi-brand | White-label, SSO, SLA, dedicated CSM, custom integrations |

### Key Changes from Current Pricing

1. **Starter: £49 → £59/mo (or £49 annual)** — Slight bump, but the real change is *removing the content playbook*. Starter becomes diagnostic-only. You see what AI says, you get alerts, but you don't get told how to fix it. That's the upgrade trigger.

2. **Growth: £149 → £179/mo (or £149 annual)** — The annual price stays at £149 (familiar anchor), but monthly is £179. This creates urgency to commit annually. 17% annual discount is industry standard.

3. **Scale: £399 → £449/mo (or £379 annual)** — Removed "done-for-you content drafts" (services trap). Replaced with API access, custom branded reports, and quarterly strategy call (scalable). 

4. **Employee band shift** — Starter goes to 100 (was 50), Growth to 1,000 (was 500). This is because:
   - Companies with 50-100 employees won't pay £179/mo — they need a cheaper entry
   - Companies with 500-1,000 employees are your best Growth customers (big enough to have budget, small enough not to need enterprise procurement)

5. **Annual billing introduced** — 15-17% discount. Critical for cash flow and churn reduction.

## 6. Launch Pricing Strategy

### Phase 1: Validation (Now → First 10 Customers)

**Don't optimise pricing yet.** The goal is to validate willingness to pay at all.

- Offer Growth at £99/month ("founding member" rate, locked for 12 months)
- This is 34% below the recommended £149 annual rate
- Easy to justify: "We're new, you're early, we're learning from you"
- Creates urgency: "Only 10 founding slots at this rate"
- Still validates the £100+/month price point

**Why £99 specifically:**
- Psychological: under £100/month = easy credit card expense
- Annualised: £1,188/year — still cheaper than every alternative
- Profitable: if LLM API costs are <£10/customer/month, margins are 90%+
- Upgrade path: after 12 months, price moves to standard £149/mo

### Phase 2: Growth (10-50 Customers)

- Standard pricing kicks in for new customers
- Founding members keep their rate
- Introduce annual billing with 15% discount
- Add agency tier when 3+ agencies show interest

### Phase 3: Optimisation (50+ Customers)

- A/B test pricing page
- Introduce usage-based pricing elements (e.g., number of AI prompts tracked)
- Consider seat-based pricing for larger teams
- Explore add-ons (e.g., competitor deep-dives, industry benchmarks)

## 8. Pricing Page Copy Recommendations

### Headline
> "Fix what AI tells candidates about you. Plans that pay for themselves with a single better hire."

### Sub-headline
> "UK employers spend £5,000-50,000/year managing their reputation on platforms candidates are leaving behind. OpenRole starts at £59/month."

### Per-Tier CTAs
- **Free:** "Run your free audit" (no signup)
- **Starter:** "Start monitoring" (email signup)
- **Growth:** "Get the full playbook" (free 14-day trial)
- **Scale:** "Talk to us" (demo booking)

### Social Proof Below Pricing
> "Trusted by [X] UK employers. Average score improvement: [X] points in 30 days."
> (Build this proof ASAP — even 3-5 early customers are enough)

### FAQ Additions
- "Can I switch plans?" → Yes, upgrade/downgrade any time
- "Is there a contract?" → No long-term contracts. Monthly or annual.
- "What if AI models change?" → We track all major models and add new ones automatically
- "How quickly will I see results?" → Most companies see AI answer changes within 2-4 weeks of publishing recommended content

## 9. Unit Economics Sanity Check

### Assumptions (per Growth customer at £149/mo)

| Item | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| LLM API calls (4 models × weekly queries) | ~£5-15 | Depends on prompt volume. Using GPT-4o-mini + Claude Haiku + Gemini Flash keeps costs low |
| Supabase (pro-rated) | ~£1-2 | Shared infrastructure |
| Resend emails (weekly report) | ~£0.10 | Well within free tier |
| Support (fractional) | ~£5-10 | Until 50+ customers |
| **Total COGS** | **~£12-27** | |
| **Gross margin** | **£122-137 (82-92%)** | Healthy SaaS margins |

### LTV Assumptions
- Average customer lifetime: 18-24 months (if churn is managed)
- LTV at 18 months: £2,682
- LTV at 24 months: £3,576
- Target CAC: <£500 (content marketing + free audit funnel)
- LTV:CAC ratio: 5-7x (excellent)
