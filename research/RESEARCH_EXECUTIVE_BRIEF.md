# AI SEO & Employer Brand Intelligence: Executive Brief

**Date:** February 2026  
**Prepared For:** Rankwell Strategic Planning  
**Research Scope:** GEO Market Landscape + Employer Branding Intersection

---

## THE OPPORTUNITY IN ONE SENTENCE

85.6% of job seekers now use AI to research employers, but no GEO platform serves this $17B employer branding vertical—creating a category-defining opportunity for Rankwell.

---

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. THE MARKET HAS SHIFTED

- **ChatGPT weekly users doubled** to 400M in early 2025 (projected to surpass Google by Oct 2030)
- **Traditional search is fragmenting** across AI platforms (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude)
- **Query behavior transformed:** 4-word Google searches → 23-word AI conversations
- **GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) has replaced SEO** as the dominant visibility discipline

### 2. JOB SEEKERS HAVE GONE AI-FIRST

| **Metric** | **Data** | **Source** |
|------------|----------|------------|
| Job seekers using AI regularly | **85.6%** | Huntr Q3 2025 |
| Use AI specifically to research companies | **21%** (of 65% total) | Adzuna March 2025 |
| Trust AI answers | **69%** | Exploding Topics 2025 |
| Increased job offer success with AI | **+75%** | Huntr 2025 |
| UK AI tool users | **18 million** | Deloitte 2024 |
| Traffic to career sites from AI | **+1,300%** in 6 months | Enhance Media March 2025 |

**Critical Insight:** Candidates use AI to ask: *"What's it like to work at [Company]?"* — and whatever AI says becomes their truth, whether accurate or not.

### 3. EMPLOYER BRANDS ARE UNIQUELY VULNERABLE

**The Hallucination Gap:**
- AI doesn't just repeat information—it **interprets, summarizes, and prioritizes**
- Official employer messaging often **buried beneath Glassdoor reviews** (which dominate AI citations due to high domain authority)
- Outdated content from 2019-2021 still cited by LLMs
- Competitors with better GEO strategy **monopolize AI responses** (winner-takes-all dynamic)

**Cost of Inaction:**
- **Qualified candidates self-select out** based on inaccurate AI intel
- **15-25% drop in top-funnel applicant quality** due to AI misrepresentation
- **£50K-£150K annual loss** per mid-size employer in increased hiring costs

### 4. THE GEO COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

**Current Players (All Horizontal):**

| **Company** | **Positioning** | **Pricing** | **Gap** |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| **Profound** | Enterprise GEO leader | £75K-£250K+/yr | Generic; no EB focus |
| **Otterly.ai** | SMB/Agency GEO | £29-£489/mo | Monitoring only; no vertical specialization |
| **Semrush/Ahrefs** | SEO platforms adding GEO | Add-on features | Late to market; GEO not core |
| **PerceptionX, BrandRank.ai** | Early-stage | Unknown/stealth | Not yet threats |

**What Nobody Does:**
1. ✗ Vertical focus on employer branding
2. ✗ Prescriptive optimization (they monitor, don't fix)
3. ✗ Integration with ATS/TA tech stack
4. ✗ Attribution to hiring outcomes
5. ✗ Pre-built employer brand prompt libraries

**→ Rankwell can own the employer brand vertical before Profound/Otterly add EB features.**

### 5. MARKET SIZING

**TAM (Total Addressable Market):**
- Global employer branding market: **$17.3B** (2024) → **$21.8B** (2026)
- Companies with careers pages globally: **~90,000**
- Realistic GEO penetration (5-10%): **4,500-9,000 customers**
- At £25K avg spend: **£112M-£225M TAM**

**SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market - UK/Europe Focus):**
- UK enterprise + mid-market employers: **~8,500 companies**
- Initial TAM (UK): **£30M** (at 25% penetration = **£7.5M**)

**SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market - Years 1-3):**
- Year 1 target: **30-50 customers** → **£750K-£1.25M ARR**
- Year 3 target: **200-300 customers** → **£5M-£7.5M ARR**

### 6. WHY RANKWELL WINS

**Unique Positioning:**
1. **First vertical GEO platform** purpose-built for employer branding
2. **Prescriptive AI audit** → not just "what AI says" but "what to fix and how"
3. **TA-aligned metrics:** Applicant quality, cost-per-hire, offer acceptance (not generic "brand mentions")
4. **UK market focus:** Underserved by US-centric platforms; GDPR-native
5. **Agency partnerships:** Leverage existing EB agencies (Universum, Blu Ivy) as channel

**Defensible Moats:**
- Vertical expertise and employer brand knowledge
- Proprietary hiring-related prompt library
- Data network effects (more customers → better benchmarks)
- Integration into TA tech stack (lock-in)

---

## THE STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE

**Timing:** The GEO category is 12-18 months old. Early movers defining verticals will own them.

**Competition:** Profound has enterprise traction but no vertical focus. Otterly serves SMBs generically. Both could add employer brand features in 12-24 months.

**Window:** **6-12 months to establish category leadership** in employer brand GEO before horizontal players react.

## RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN

### Phase 1: UK Enterprise Beachhead (Q2-Q4 2026)
- Launch freemium AI audit tool (lead gen)
- Target: FTSE 250, high-growth tech, professional services
- Partnerships: UK employer brand agencies
- Goal: 30-50 paying customers, £750K-£1.25M ARR

### Phase 2: Product-Market Fit & Expansion (2027)
- Prove ROI: track applicant quality improvement
- US market entry (Fortune 1000 TA teams)
- Platform evolution: monitoring → optimization → automation
- Goal: 200+ customers, £5M+ ARR

### Phase 3: Category Leadership (2028+)
- Build integrations (ATS, CRM, career site CMS)
- Acquire/partner with employer brand content agencies
- Expand to GEO content generation (AI-optimized job descriptions, EVP pages)
- Goal: £15M+ ARR, clear category leader

## BOTTOM LINE

**The Problem:** 85% of job seekers use AI to research employers, but employer brands have no visibility or control over what AI says about them.

**The Solution:** Rankwell = AI Reputation Intelligence for Employers. Audit → Monitor → Fix.

**The Market:** $17B employer branding industry × 65-86% AI adoption = massive, underserved opportunity.

**The Competition:** No vertical leader exists. 6-12 month window to own the category.

**The ROI:** £25K Rankwell investment prevents £50K-£150K annual loss from AI misrepresentation. 2x-6x first-year ROI.

**The Ask:** Execute fast. Launch Q2 2026. Own employer brand GEO before Profound or Otterly wake up.

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Product:** Finalize AI audit MVP (identify top 20 employer brand prompts)
2. **GTM:** Build freemium funnel (free audit → paid monitoring)
3. **Partnerships:** Outreach to 3-5 UK employer brand agencies
4. **Funding:** Secure £500K-£1M seed to fund 12-month runway
5. **Hiring:** Hire founding AE + EB subject matter expert
6. **Launch:** Public launch at UK TA conference (RecFest or similar) Q2 2026
