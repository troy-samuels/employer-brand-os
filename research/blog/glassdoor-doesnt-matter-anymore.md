# Why Your Glassdoor Profile Doesn't Matter Anymore

*You've been obsessing over the wrong platform. Here's where candidates actually form their opinions now.*

---

Let me save you a meeting. That Glassdoor response strategy you've been refining? The one where you carefully reply to every negative review with something empathetic but corporate? It's not wrong, exactly. It's just increasingly irrelevant.

Not because Glassdoor has gone away. It hasn't. But because the way candidates use it — or rather, *used* to use it — has fundamentally changed. And most employer branding teams haven't caught up.

## How candidates actually research employers now

A year ago, the candidate journey looked something like this: see a job ad, Google the company, click on Glassdoor, read a handful of reviews, maybe check LinkedIn, then decide whether to apply. Your Glassdoor profile was a genuine inflection point.

Today, increasingly, it looks like this: see a job ad, ask ChatGPT "Is [Company] a good place to work?", read the answer, decide. Done. No clicking. No browsing. No weighing multiple sources. Just one synthesised answer from an AI that sounds supremely confident whether it's right or not.

Tucker Barker documented this shift in a LinkedIn article in November 2025 that should have set off alarm bells across the employer branding industry: "The candidates you want to hire are already using AI to research employers. If your brand doesn't perform well in these new discovery channels, you're losing talent before they even visit your careers page."

Read that last part again. Before they even visit your careers page. Forget Glassdoor — they're not getting to *any* of your owned channels.

## Glassdoor is now a data source, not a destination

This is the crucial distinction. Glassdoor still matters — but not in the way you think.

Your Glassdoor reviews, along with your LinkedIn page, your careers site, Reddit threads about your company, news articles, and dozens of other sources, all get ingested by AI models. They become raw material. The AI synthesises all of it into a single answer that the candidate reads instead of visiting any of those sources directly.

As Single Grain's guide on Generative Engine Optimisation puts it: "Generative engines synthesise information from multiple sources, then answer with a single overview or recommendation, often without sending traffic to every source they used."

Your Glassdoor profile hasn't disappeared. It's been absorbed into a process you can't see, can't influence, and aren't monitoring.

VONQ's 2025 research report confirmed this is already reshaping recruitment marketing: AI search platforms like Perplexity, ChatGPT, and Google's AI Overviews now surface employer brand content directly — and employers have "no optimisation strategy" for these new channels.

Think about what that means. You might have a 4.2-star Glassdoor rating, a thoughtful response to every review, and a carefully maintained employer profile. None of that matters if ChatGPT decides to weight a three-year-old Reddit thread more heavily, or hallucinates a salary range that puts candidates off, or confuses your company with another one entirely.

## The AI trust problem

Here's where it gets genuinely concerning. AI doesn't just passively summarise information — it actively gets things wrong. And it does so with total confidence.

AB&C Creative published a sharp analysis in January 2026: "If your careers site says one thing, your Glassdoor reviews say another and your employees tell a third story, AI will surface the confusion, not the clarity."

That's the best-case scenario — where the underlying information exists but is contradictory. The worst case is pure fabrication.

Dean Chan's analysis of AI hallucinations on LinkedIn makes the stakes plain: "Even if 90% of the AI's answers are correct, the 10% that are hallucinated can dominate public perception." And when it comes to employer reputation, that 10% might be the salary data, the culture description, or the claim about a round of redundancies that never happened.

The [KonBriefing AI incidents tracker](https://konbriefing.com/ai/en/ai-incidents-2025.html) documented dozens of cases across fifteen-plus countries in 2025 where AI misinformation created tangible consequences — from fined lawyers to dismissed court filings. If AI can fabricate case law convincingly enough to fool solicitors, it can certainly fabricate employer information convincingly enough to fool candidates.

## The Prompt Test: a two-minute reality check

Tucker Barker proposed something he calls the "Prompt Test," and it's the single most useful thing you can do today. It takes two minutes.

Open ChatGPT. Open Perplexity. Open Gemini. Open Claude.

In each one, type: **"Is [Your Company] a good place to work?"**

Then type: **"What's the salary range for [common role] at [Your Company]?"**

Read what comes back.

Barker's observation: "Most companies haven't figured this out yet." And he's right. The vast majority of HR teams have never run this test. They're optimising a Glassdoor profile that candidates increasingly bypass while ignoring the AI responses that actually shape perception.

What you'll likely find is a mixed bag. Some accurate information, some outdated details, some outright fabrications, all blended together and presented as authoritative fact. No star rating to game. No review to respond to. Just an AI's verdict on your company, delivered to candidates who take it at face value.

## Why Glassdoor can't adapt fast enough

Glassdoor isn't oblivious to this shift. But the platform faces a structural problem: it was built for a world where candidates actively visit websites to read reviews. The AI era replaces that behaviour with a passive receive-the-answer model.

Even if Glassdoor optimises its content to be more AI-friendly — more structured data, better schema markup, clearer signals — it's still just one input among many. And it's competing with Reddit (which AI models love for its candid, unfiltered tone), LinkedIn posts, news articles, and whatever else the model has ingested.

The competitive landscape research tells the same story. Platforms like Glassdoor, Indeed, Comparably, and Blind are all *inputs* to AI models. They don't monitor or optimise the *outputs*. Your Glassdoor strategy addresses one data source. Your AI reputation is the result of all of them combined — and nobody's managing the combination.

## The invisible drop-off

The most insidious part of this shift is that it's invisible. When a candidate reads a bad Glassdoor review and doesn't apply, you at least know Glassdoor exists as a factor. You might see traffic patterns, referral sources, or survey data pointing to it.

When a candidate asks ChatGPT about your company, gets a lukewarm or inaccurate answer, and moves on to the next company — nothing. No signal. No data. No trace. They never visited your site, never entered your ATS, never appeared in any funnel metric. They simply ceased to exist as a potential applicant.

AB&C Creative frames the downstream damage: "Poor experiences lead to negative reviews. Negative reviews lead to weaker AI perception. Weaker perception leads to lower visibility and lower candidate trust." It's a doom loop, and the traditional intervention points — responding to reviews, updating your careers page — operate too far downstream to break it.

Meanwhile, only [8% of candidates who click "Apply" actually complete the application](https://blogcontent.abccreative.com/2026/01/21/built-to-be-found-5-ways-to-win-employer-brand-recognition-in-ai-based-search), according to AB&C Creative's 2026 research. That was already a shocking figure. Now consider that a growing number of candidates aren't even getting to the "click Apply" stage because AI intercepted them first.

## What this means for your employer brand strategy

I'm not suggesting you abandon Glassdoor entirely. Reviews still matter as a data source — they feed the AI models that now matter more. Keep responding, keep the profile updated, keep encouraging honest reviews.

But if Glassdoor is where you're spending the majority of your employer branding energy and budget, you're optimising for yesterday's candidate journey.

The new priority list looks like this:

**1. Consistency across every source.** AI synthesises everything. If your careers page, your Glassdoor reviews, your LinkedIn content, and your employee advocacy all tell a coherent story, AI is more likely to reflect that story accurately. Contradictions get amplified, not averaged out.

**2. Structured, factual content.** AI needs clear signals. Publish unambiguous information about your culture, benefits, salary bands, and working conditions in formats that AI can parse without guessing. Vague employer brand fluff like "we're a family" gives AI nothing useful to work with.

**3. Monitor AI outputs, not just inputs.** Run the Prompt Test quarterly at minimum. Track what AI says about you over time. This is the new metric that matters — not your Glassdoor star rating, but your AI perception score.

**4. Think GEO, not just SEO.** VONQ's research makes it clear that Generative Engine Optimisation for recruitment is an emerging discipline. The companies that figure it out first will have a measurable advantage in talent acquisition. The companies that ignore it will keep wondering why their pipeline is thinning.

## The bottom line

Your Glassdoor profile is a relic of a candidate journey that's rapidly being replaced. Not completely — not yet — but the direction is unmistakable. Candidates are moving from "search and browse" to "ask and receive," and the intermediary is an AI that doesn't care about your response strategy, your star rating, or the thirty hours you spent crafting the perfect employer brand video.

What AI cares about is the sum total of every piece of information about your company it has ever encountered, weighted by algorithms you can't see, synthesised into an answer you can't edit, delivered to candidates you'll never know about.

That's the new game. And the first step to playing it is finding out what AI is actually saying about you right now.
