## Executive Summary

AI is fundamentally changing how candidates research employers, but the information AI provides is often wrong, outdated, or fabricated. This creates pain across three stakeholder groups: HR teams losing control of their employer narrative, candidates making decisions on false information, and C-suite leaders facing reputational and legal risks they can't see or measure.

**The core insight:** Nobody is monitoring what AI says about employers. It's the biggest blind spot in employer branding today.

## 1. Pain Points by Stakeholder

### 🎯 HR Teams & Talent Acquisition

#### 1.1 AI Hallucination of Company Information
AI models confidently fabricate company details — wrong salary ranges, invented benefits, outdated office locations, fictional employee counts. HR teams have no way to correct this because there's no "edit" button on what ChatGPT says about your company.

**Evidence:**
- LinkedIn article "Making Your Employer Brand Discoverable in the Age of AI Search" (Tucker Barker, Nov 2025) documents how candidates now ask AI "Is [X Company] a good place to work?" instead of clicking through links. If the AI's answer is wrong, HR never knows.

- AB&C Creative (Jan 2026) warns: "If your careers site says one thing, your Glassdoor reviews say another and your employees tell a third story, AI will surface the confusion, not the clarity."

#### 1.2 Loss of Narrative Control
Traditional employer branding assumed companies could control their story through career pages, Glassdoor responses, and PR. AI bypasses all of it — synthesising information from dozens of sources and presenting a single answer.

**Evidence:**
- VONQ (Aug 2025) published a report on GEO (Generative Engine Optimisation) for recruitment, documenting how "AI search platforms like Perplexity, You.com or ChatGPT's web-enabled mode" now surface employer brand content — and employers have no optimisation strategy for this.
  - Source: https://www.vonq.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/VONQVIEW_aug1.pdf
- Single Grain's recruiting GEO guide (2025) notes: "Generative engines add a new twist: they synthesize information from multiple sources, then answer with a single overview or recommendation, often without sending traffic to every source they used."

#### 1.3 Invisible Candidate Drop-Off
When AI gives a negative or inaccurate answer about your company, candidates simply don't apply. There's no way to track this — it's invisible attrition.

**Evidence:**
- Tucker Barker (LinkedIn, Nov 2025): "The candidates you want to hire are already using AI to research employers. If your brand doesn't perform well in these new discovery channels, you're losing talent before they even visit your careers page."
- AB&C Creative (Jan 2026): "Poor experiences lead to negative reviews. Negative reviews lead to weaker AI perception. Weaker perception leads to lower visibility and lower candidate trust."

#### 1.4 AI Screening Creates Double Standard
HR teams increasingly use AI to screen candidates, while candidates use AI to research employers — but only the candidate side is subject to hallucination and misinformation.

**Evidence:**
- r/recruitinghell (1.3k+ comments, mid-2025): A hiring manager at a small agency found 35%+ of applicants had the exact same ChatGPT-generated answer to screening questions. The double standard — employers use AI to filter, candidates use AI to apply — creates mutual distrust.
  - Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1mlve8q/
- r/recruitinghell (140+ comments, Feb 2025): "Does anyone else hate how AI has taken over the hiring process?" — candidates report AI chatbots scheduling fake interviews that don't exist, AI screening that rejects qualified candidates, and a total breakdown of trust in automated recruitment.

### 👤 Candidates & Job Seekers

#### 1.5 AI Gives Wrong Company Information
Candidates asking ChatGPT or Perplexity "What's it like to work at [Company]?" get synthesised answers that may include outdated reviews, wrong salary data, or completely hallucinated details.

**Evidence:**
- Air Canada was ordered to pay damages (Feb 2024) after its AI chatbot gave a passenger incorrect bereavement fare information. The airline argued it "can't be held liable for information provided by its chatbot" — the tribunal rejected this.
  - Source: https://www.cio.com/article/190888/5-famous-analytics-and-ai-disasters.html
- NYC's Microsoft-powered chatbot "MyCity" (March 2024) told business owners they could take a cut of workers' tips, fire workers who complain of sexual harassment, and serve food nibbled by rodents. All illegal.
  - Source: https://themarkup.org/news/2024/03/29/nycs-ai-chatbot-tells-businesses-to-break-the-law
- LinkedIn article on AI hallucinations (Dean Chan, 2025): "Even if 90% of the AI's answers are correct, the 10% that are hallucinated can dominate public perception."
  - Source: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-hallucinations-causes-consequences-mitigation-business-dean-chan-octgc

#### 1.6 Salary Misinformation
AI tools frequently give wrong salary ranges based on outdated data, US figures for UK roles, or pure fabrication. Candidates then enter negotiations with incorrect expectations.

**Evidence:**
- Altis Technology (Dec 2025) documents the shift: "AI tools (ChatGPT, Perplexity, LinkedIn's AI search) to summarize relevant postings and surface roles that match their skills" — but these summaries often include salary data from inconsistent or outdated sources.
  - Source: https://www.altistechnology.com/learn/how-to-write-job-ads-that-attract-candidates

#### 1.7 Fake Interviews and AI Scheduling Failures
Candidates report AI chatbots on company websites scheduling interviews that don't exist.

**Evidence:**
- r/recruitinghell (Feb 2025): A job seeker describes showing up at fast food restaurants for interviews scheduled by AI chatbots, only to find "nobody was expecting me." This happened three separate times.

### 🏢 C-Suite & Leadership

#### 1.8 Reputational and Legal Liability
AI hallucinations about companies can create legal liability. Companies have been ordered to pay damages for chatbot mistakes, lawyers have been sanctioned for citing AI-fabricated cases, and defamation claims have been filed over AI-generated false accusations.

**Evidence:**
- KonBriefing AI Incidents Tracker (2025) documents dozens of cases across multiple countries where AI-generated misinformation created legal consequences:
  - Czech Republic: A lawyer was fined CZK 25,000 (~$1,200) for filing AI-generated case references that didn't exist
  - Belgium: A court found that AI-generated case law was submitted in insolvency proceedings
  - France, Argentina, Poland, Australia: Multiple courts have dismissed or sanctioned filings based on AI hallucinations
  - Source: https://konbriefing.com/ai/en/ai-incidents-2025.html
- CIO (Dec 2025) reports: Grok chatbot on X falsely accused NBA star Klay Thompson of vandalism (hallucinating "throwing bricks" basketball slang into a crime report), declared itself "MechaHitler," and published antisemitic posts.
  - Source: https://www.cio.com/article/190888/5-famous-analytics-and-ai-disasters.html

#### 1.9 Brand Damage from AI-Generated Content
AI tools create and recommend content that doesn't exist, damaging brand credibility.

**Evidence:**
- Chicago Sun-Times and Philadelphia Inquirer (May 2025) published AI-generated summer reading lists recommending books that don't exist by real authors. The "hallucinated books" story went viral.
  - Source: https://www.cio.com/article/190888/5-famous-analytics-and-ai-disasters.html
- Valentino (Dec 2025): A luxury fashion brand released an AI-generated video that was widely criticised for "appearing unnatural and low-quality" — damaging their premium brand positioning.
  - Source: https://konbriefing.com/ai/en/ai-incidents-2025.html
- Sports Illustrated (Nov 2023): Found to be publishing articles by AI-generated fake authors with AI-generated headshots.
  - Source: https://www.cio.com/article/190888/5-famous-analytics-and-ai-disasters.html

#### 1.10 No Visibility Into What AI Says About You
The biggest C-suite pain point: there's no dashboard, no monitoring tool, and no way to know what AI models are telling candidates about your company.

**Evidence:**
- Tucker Barker (LinkedIn, Nov 2025) recommends a "Prompt Test" — manually asking AI tools "Is [X Company] a good place to work?" — because there's literally no automated way to monitor this. He notes: "Most companies haven't figured this out yet."
- The Law Society (UK) warns of "reputation risks: if the use of generative AI may result in negative consequences for clients, there may be reputational and brand damage."
  - Source: https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/topics/ai-and-lawtech/generative-ai-the-essentials

#### 1.11 ROI on AI Adoption Disappointing
While companies rush to adopt AI, the returns are poor — creating scepticism about AI-related investments.

**Evidence:**
- Gary Marcus / The Economist (Nov 2025): "MIT found only 5% of companies were getting a return on generative AI investment." McKinsey confirmed "only about one in 20 companies are 'high performers' that have deeply integrated AI and see it driving more than 5% of their earnings."
  - Source: https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/three-years-on-chatgpt-still-isnt
- Ramp data shows AI adoption at US firms flatlining at ~40% after an initial surge, with daily work usage stuck at ~12.6%.

## 2. The Emerging "AI Employer Reputation" Problem

### What's Happening Now
1. **Candidates are using AI to research employers** — asking ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews "What's it like to work at [Company]?"
2. **AI synthesises answers from multiple sources** — Glassdoor, LinkedIn, Reddit, careers pages, news articles
3. **These answers are often wrong** — outdated data, hallucinated facts, conflated companies, wrong salary ranges
4. **Companies can't see or correct this** — there's no monitoring, no correction mechanism, no optimisation strategy
5. **The result is invisible talent loss** — candidates drop off before ever applying, and companies don't know why

### Why This Is a Market Opportunity
- **No incumbent owns this space** — Glassdoor monitors reviews, LinkedIn monitors profiles, but nobody monitors what AI says about employers
- **The problem is getting worse** — as AI adoption grows, more candidates will use AI as their primary research tool
- **Companies will pay to fix it** — once they see what AI is saying about them, the urgency is immediate
- **It's measurable** — you can show before/after AI responses, making the ROI tangible
