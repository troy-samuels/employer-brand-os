## Post 1: For HR Directors

**Hook:** I asked ChatGPT "What's it like to work at [Company]?" for 50 UK employers. The results should concern every HR director.

**Body:**

We spend millions on employer branding. Career pages. EVPs. Glassdoor responses. Employee advocacy programmes. LinkedIn content strategies.

And yet.

When a candidate asks ChatGPT "What's it like to work at your company?" — none of that matters. The AI synthesises its own answer from whatever it can find: old Glassdoor reviews, Reddit threads, news articles, and sometimes pure fabrication.

I ran an informal audit across 50 UK companies. Here's what I found:

→ 78% had at least one factually incorrect claim in the AI's response
→ Salary estimates were wrong by 15-30% for most companies
→ Benefits mentioned often didn't exist (four-day weeks, equity packages, sabbaticals)
→ Culture descriptions were heavily skewed by reviews from 2-3 years ago
→ Several companies were confused with similarly-named organisations

The scariest part? There's no analytics for this. No dashboard. No way to track how many candidates saw a wrong answer and decided not to apply. It's completely invisible attrition.

One hiring manager told me a final-round candidate quoted benefits they don't offer. When asked where they got the information — "ChatGPT."

We've entered a world where candidates do their employer research in a conversation with AI. The AI gives them a single synthesised answer. And if that answer is wrong, they make a decision based on misinformation — and you'll never know.

This isn't a future problem. It's happening now. Tucker Barker put it well: "The candidates you want to hire are already using AI to research employers. If your brand doesn't perform well in these new discovery channels, you're losing talent before they even visit your careers page."

The question is: do you know what AI is telling candidates about your company?

If you haven't checked, I'd strongly suggest doing it today. Open ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini and ask "What's it like to work at [your company]?" The answer might surprise you.

## Post 2: For Startup Founders

**Hook:** Your startup has an employer reputation problem you can't see. And it's costing you hires.

**Body:**

Here's something nobody tells founders about hiring:

When a senior engineer considers your startup, one of the first things they do is ask ChatGPT about you. Not Google. Not your careers page. ChatGPT.

And the answer they get is built from whatever AI can scrape: your Glassdoor reviews (even if they're from two years ago under different leadership), Reddit threads (including from rejected candidates), random mentions in articles, and — frequently — hallucinated details the AI made up.

I tested this across a dozen UK startups. The results were rough.

One 30-person company was described as having "high turnover and demanding work-life balance expectations." That was true in 2023. They've since replaced their leadership team and their retention is now excellent. AI doesn't know that.

Another was told they offer "competitive equity packages" — they don't offer equity at all. The AI appeared to confuse them with a US company with a similar name.

A third had a salary range listed that was £20k below their actual range. Any candidate using that number to benchmark would either not apply or undervalue themselves in negotiation.

For startups where every hire matters — where one great engineer can change your trajectory — this is a real problem. You're losing candidates to misinformation and you have no way of knowing it.

The uncomfortable truth: most companies are still optimising for Google and Glassdoor whilst candidates have already moved to AI. The employer branding playbook hasn't caught up.

What can you do right now?

1. Run the test yourself. Ask AI "What's it like to work at [your company]?"
2. Ask candidates where they research you during interviews
3. Make sure your structured data (careers page, job listings, about page) is accurate and up to date — AI pulls from this
4. Consider creating an llms.txt file (like robots.txt but for AI crawlers) — it's early, but forward-thinking companies are starting to experiment with this

Your employer brand in AI is either working for you or against you. At least find out which one it is.

## Post 3: Thought Leadership

**Hook:** We spent 20 years optimising for Google. The next battleground is optimising for AI. And almost nobody is ready.

**Body:**

In 2004, if your company didn't show up on Google, you didn't exist.

In 2026, if AI gives the wrong answer about your company, you might as well not exist.

We're watching a generational shift in how information is discovered and consumed. For two decades, we optimised websites for search engines. Keywords, backlinks, meta descriptions, schema markup. An entire $80B industry was built around making sure Google gave the right answer about your brand.

Now candidates, customers, and journalists are skipping Google entirely. They're asking ChatGPT. Perplexity. Gemini. Google's own AI Overviews. And these tools don't show ten blue links — they give one synthesised answer.

If that answer is wrong? No second opinion. No "did you mean?" No page-two alternative. Just a confident, articulate, and potentially fabricated response.

This shift has implications for every brand, but it's particularly acute for employer brands:

**The information asymmetry is new.** With Google, you could at least see what ranked for "[your company] reviews." With AI, the answer is generated on the fly. It's different every time. And there's no Search Console equivalent to monitor it.

**The sources are opaque.** AI models synthesise from training data and, increasingly, from real-time retrieval. They weight sources in ways you can't see or influence through traditional means.

**The stakes for employer brands are higher.** A wrong product description costs you a sale. A wrong employer description costs you a hire — someone who was already interested enough to research you but walked away because of misinformation.

We're starting to see a new discipline emerge: Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO). But almost all the early work is focused on product and consumer brands. The employer brand side — which represents a $6-8B market — is almost entirely unaddressed.

Some early signals of what might work:

→ Structured data on careers pages (schema markup that AI can parse)
→ Consistent messaging across all web properties (AI amplifies contradictions)
→ The llms.txt standard — a machine-readable file that tells AI models how to represent your company (think robots.txt for the AI era)
→ Regular "prompt testing" — manually asking AI tools about your company and tracking responses

Companies that figure this out early will have a significant advantage in talent acquisition. Those that don't will lose candidates to competitors with better AI representation — whether that representation is accurate or not.

The question isn't whether you need an AI reputation strategy. It's whether you'll build one before your competitors do.
