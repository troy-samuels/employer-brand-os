## Thread 1: The Research Findings

**Thread title (internal):** "What AI tells candidates about employers is mostly wrong"

---

**1/ 🧵**
I tested what ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini say about 50 UK companies when you ask "What's it like to work there?"

The results are genuinely alarming.

Here's what I found ↓

---

**2/**
78% of companies had at least one factually wrong claim in the AI response.

Not "slightly off." Wrong. Fabricated benefits. Incorrect salary ranges. Culture descriptions based on 3-year-old Glassdoor reviews.

The AI states everything with total confidence.

---

**3/**
Salary estimates were wrong by 15-30% for most companies.

One UK company was quoted a salary based on US market rates. Another had a range that was £20k below their actual offers.

Imagine losing a candidate because they think your pay is terrible — based on a hallucination.

---

**4/**
AI heavily weights two sources: Glassdoor and Reddit.

If your Glassdoor rating dropped in 2022 and you've since turned things around? AI doesn't know. It's serving candidates a narrative about a company that no longer exists.

---

**5/**
Several companies were confused with similarly-named organisations.

A 200-person consultancy was described with details from a multinational conglomerate with a similar name. Different industry. Different continent.

The AI didn't flag any uncertainty.

---

**6/**
The scariest part: this is invisible attrition.

When a candidate asks AI about your company and gets a bad answer, they just... don't apply. No bounce. No abandoned form. No data point at all.

You're losing hires and you literally cannot see it.

---

**7/**
For context: we spent 20 years building an $80B SEO industry to optimise what Google shows about brands.

Right now, almost zero companies are optimising what AI says about them as employers.

This is a massive blind spot.

---

**8/**
Some stats that matter:

- Only 5% of companies are getting ROI from their GenAI investments (MIT, 2025)
- Yet AI adoption for candidate research is growing rapidly
- Air Canada was ordered to pay damages for chatbot misinformation
- Courts in 15+ countries have sanctioned AI-generated false info

---

**9/**
The emerging term for this is "Generative Engine Optimisation" (GEO) — optimising for AI responses rather than search rankings.

But all the early GEO tools focus on product brands.

For employer brands? Nothing. Nobody is monitoring this space.

---

**10/**
What can you do right now?

1. Ask ChatGPT "What's it like to work at [your company]?" — seriously, do it today
2. Check Perplexity and Gemini too — they give different answers
3. Screenshot what you find
4. Panic appropriately

---

**11/**
Companies that figure out employer brand GEO early will have a massive hiring advantage.

Everyone else will keep wondering why their application rates are declining while their careers page looks great.

The answer is in the AI. Go check yours.

## Thread 2: llms.txt as a Concept

**Thread title (internal):** "llms.txt: robots.txt for the AI era"

---

**1/ 🧵**
There's a new web standard emerging that most people haven't heard of yet: llms.txt

It might become as important for AI as robots.txt was for search engines.

Here's what it is and why it matters ↓

---

**2/**
robots.txt tells search engines what to crawl and how to index your site. It's been the backbone of SEO since the 90s.

llms.txt does something similar — but for AI models.

It gives AI a machine-readable summary of who you are and what you do.

---

**3/**
The problem it solves is simple: AI models synthesise information about your company from dozens of sources. Many of those sources are wrong, outdated, or irrelevant.

llms.txt lets you provide a canonical, structured source of truth that AI can reference.

---

**4/**
The format is straightforward. A markdown file at yoursite.com/llms.txt that contains:

- What your company does
- Key facts (size, location, industry)
- Links to authoritative pages
- What you want AI to know (and not confuse)

---

**5/**
Why this matters for employer brands specifically:

When someone asks AI "What's it like to work at [Company]?" — the AI currently pulls from Glassdoor, Reddit, news, whatever it finds.

llms.txt could give it a verified source of employer information instead.

---

**6/**
Think about it: you control what your careers page says. You control your Glassdoor responses. You control your LinkedIn company page.

But you have zero control over how AI synthesises all of that into a single answer.

llms.txt is a step toward changing that.

---

**7/**
Some early adopters are already experimenting with it.

It's not a magic fix — AI models don't have to respect llms.txt any more than search engines had to respect robots.txt in the early days.

But it's a signal. And AI models are increasingly built to look for exactly these kinds of signals.

---

**8/**
The broader shift here is from "optimise for search engines" to "optimise for AI models."

SEO → GEO (Generative Engine Optimisation)
robots.txt → llms.txt
Meta descriptions → structured context for AI
Backlinks → source authority in AI training data

---

**9/**
The companies thinking about this now are going to be ahead of everyone else in 12 months.

Just like early SEO adopters dominated search rankings while competitors were still buying newspaper ads.

---

**10/**
What's fascinating is that this isn't just about marketing. It's about:

- Employer branding (what AI tells candidates)
- Reputation management (what AI tells journalists)
- Sales (what AI tells prospects)
- Customer trust (what AI tells everyone)

---

**11/**
The standard is still early. There's no Google Search Console equivalent for AI. No analytics. No way to confirm AI models are reading your llms.txt.

But that's exactly what the SEO world looked like in 1998.

And we know how that played out.

---

**12/**
If you're a founder, marketer, or HR leader: worth paying attention to llms.txt now.

The cost of setting one up is near zero. The potential upside is significant.

At minimum, go check what AI currently says about your company. You might be surprised — and not in a good way.
