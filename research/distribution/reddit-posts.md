**Title:** Has anyone actually checked what ChatGPT says about your company to candidates?

**Body:**

So I've been going down a bit of a rabbit hole this week. A candidate in a final-round interview mentioned something about our benefits that was completely wrong — we don't offer a four-day work week. When I asked where they got that from, they said "I asked ChatGPT."

Out of curiosity I tried it myself. Asked ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini "What's it like to work at [our company]?" and holy shit. The salary ranges were wrong. It mentioned a "generous equity package" we don't have. It described our culture as "fast-paced startup energy" — we're a 200-person company that's been around for 11 years.

I tried a few of our competitors too. Same thing. Fabricated benefits, wrong headcounts, outdated info from Glassdoor reviews that are 3+ years old.

The thing that worries me is that candidates are making decisions based on this. They're not even visiting our careers page anymore — they're just asking AI and taking the answer at face value. We've spent thousands on employer branding and none of it matters if ChatGPT is telling people something completely different.

Has anyone else looked into this? Is there any way to actually influence what AI says about you as an employer? I've seen some stuff about "generative engine optimisation" but it all seems focused on product brands, not employer brands.

Genuinely curious if anyone's found a solution because this feels like a massive blind spot.

**Title:** AI is giving candidates wrong salary data about our roles and it's killing negotiations

**Body:**

I'm a TA lead at a mid-size tech company and I've noticed a pattern over the last few months. Candidates are coming into salary negotiations with numbers that don't match our ranges at all — and not just a little off, like 20-30% wrong in either direction.

After the third time this happened, I started asking where they got their numbers. Almost every time it's "I looked it up on ChatGPT" or "Perplexity said the average for this role at your company is X."

So I tested it. Asked multiple AI tools what the salary range is for a Senior Developer at our company. Got four different answers, none of them correct. One quoted a US average (we're UK-based). Another seemed to have pulled a number from a 2022 Glassdoor estimate for a completely different seniority level.

The frustrating part is that we post salary ranges on every job listing. But candidates trust the AI answer over our actual job ad. And when we tell them the real range is lower than what ChatGPT said, we look like we're lowballing.

Anyone else dealing with this? It feels like a new problem that nobody's really talking about yet. I'm starting to wonder if we need to optimise for AI the same way we used to optimise for Google.

## Post 3: r/startups

**Title:** Your startup's employer reputation in AI might be sabotaging your hiring and you'd never know

**Body:**

Something I've been thinking about that I don't see discussed enough: what do AI tools actually say about your company when candidates ask?

We're a 40-person startup. Hiring is already hard enough. But I recently discovered that when someone asks ChatGPT "What's it like to work at [our company]?" they get an answer that's based on a mix of a few negative Glassdoor reviews from 2023 (when we were going through a rough patch), a Reddit thread from someone who got rejected, and what seems to be entirely fabricated information about our culture.

The AI literally described us as "a company with high turnover and demanding work-life balance expectations" — which was true two years ago under different leadership but is completely wrong now. We've made massive changes, our retention is great, and our latest employee survey was the best we've ever had. None of that shows up.

For an early-stage company where every hire matters, this is terrifying. A senior engineer could ask ChatGPT about us, get a terrible answer, and we'd never even know they were interested. There's no bounce rate to track. No application to follow up on. They just... don't apply.

I think this is going to become a much bigger issue for startups that don't have the brand recognition to override what AI synthesises from random web sources. Does anyone have thoughts on how to deal with this?

## Post 4: r/marketing

**Title:** GEO for employer brands is an untouched market — here's what I found when I researched it

**Body:**

I work in marketing and I've been following the whole GEO (Generative Engine Optimisation) conversation. Most of it focuses on product and consumer brands — making sure your product shows up when someone asks ChatGPT for recommendations.

But I got curious about the employer side. When candidates ask "Is [Company] a good place to work?" — what happens? So I ran my own informal audit across about 20 companies (mix of tech, finance, and retail). Here's what I found:

**The accuracy problem is real.** Roughly 3 out of 4 companies had at least one factually wrong claim in the AI response — wrong salary ranges, fabricated benefits, outdated information presented as current.

**AI heavily weights Glassdoor and Reddit.** These two sources seem to dominate what AI models synthesise about employers. If your Glassdoor rating tanked in 2022 and you've since improved, AI doesn't know that.

**Almost nobody is optimising for this.** I checked whether any of these 20 companies had structured data, llms.txt files, or any AI-specific content strategy for employer brand. Zero.

**The GEO tools that exist are all generic.** Otterly.ai, Profound, and a few others do AI brand monitoring — but none are purpose-built for employer reputation.

This feels like a massive gap. The employer branding market is $6-8B globally and growing. The entire industry is focused on careers pages and Glassdoor responses while candidates are increasingly just asking AI. Is anyone actually working on this?

**Title:** PSA: don't trust what ChatGPT says about a company's salary or culture — tested it on 20 companies

**Body:**

Just a heads up for anyone using AI to research companies before applying or interviewing.

I was prepping for an interview last month and asked ChatGPT about the company's culture and salary range. The answer sounded really confident and detailed. Got the offer, and the actual salary was £15k higher than what ChatGPT told me. If I'd anchored my negotiation on the AI's number, I would've left money on the table.

After that I got curious and tested a bunch of companies. Asked ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini "What's the salary for a mid-level software engineer at [Company]?" and "What's the work culture like at [Company]?" for about 20 companies I could verify.

Results were genuinely bad. Most salary ranges were wrong by 15-30%. Some had the right ballpark but attributed benefits to the wrong company (I think it was confusing similarly-named companies). A few described culture in ways that clearly came from years-old Glassdoor reviews.

The worst part is the AI sounds completely confident. There's no "I'm not sure about this" caveat. It just states things as fact.

My advice: always check the actual job posting, talk to real employees on LinkedIn, or check recent Glassdoor reviews (within the last year). AI is great for a lot of things, but company research isn't one of them yet. The models are basically averaging out-of-date reviews and guessing.
