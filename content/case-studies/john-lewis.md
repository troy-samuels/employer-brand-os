# John Lewis Partnership: AI Employer Visibility Audit

## Executive Summary
John Lewis Partnership presents a unique employer brand as the UK's largest employee-owned business, with strong mission-driven content. However, technical AI visibility infrastructure is minimal.

## Findings

### 1. AI Crawler Policies (robots.txt)
**Status:** ✅ Open to AI crawlers

- **Location:** https://www.johnlewis.com/robots.txt
- **AI Bot Blocking:** None detected
- **Key Crawlers Status:** All AI crawlers allowed
- **Date:** Last updated 2025-07-25

**Analysis:** Focused on preventing crawling of navigation filters, account pages, and gift finder tools. No AI bot restrictions.

### 2. LLM Discovery Files
**Status:** ❌ Not implemented

- No llms.txt discovered

### 3. Careers Page Structure
**URL:** https://www.johnlewispartnership.co.uk/careers

**Content Quality:** ✅ Excellent employer brand differentiation

Key messaging:
- **Unique Positioning:** "Owned by partners, driven by strategy, and built on trust"
- **Dual Brand Strategy:** John Lewis (150+ years heritage, omni-channel retail) + Waitrose (food excellence)
- **Values-Driven:** "Reimagining retail while staying true to what matters most"
- **Social Impact:** "Building Happier Futures" programme with Action for Children
- **Sustainability:** Comprehensive ethics focus areas including supply chains, community & health, environment

**Employer Brand Strengths:**
- Clear mission: "Work in partnership for a happier world"
- Partnership structure (employee ownership) heavily featured
- Compassion in farming awards (Good Pig Award since 2012)
- Multi-layered sustainability commitments
- Specific programme initiatives with measurable impact

### 4. Structured Data (JSON-LD)
**Status:** ⚠️ Not verified

Could not access careers page HTML to verify JobPosting schema. The corporate site redirected to homepage rather than careers landing page.

### 5. Salary Transparency
**Status:** ❌ Not visible

No salary information found on careers overview pages.

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Fix Careers URL** - https://www.johnlewispartnership.co.uk/careers.html redirects to homepage; ensure direct access to careers content
2. **Implement llms.txt** - Point AI systems to unique employer value props (partnership model, sustainability, social impact)
3. **Structure Unique Story** - The employee ownership model is a differentiator AI should easily discover

### Medium Priority
4. **Add JSON-LD** - Ensure job postings include structured data with organization context
5. **Highlight Compensation Philosophy** - If partnership model affects compensation (profit sharing, etc.), make this discoverable

### Low Priority
6. **Track "Employee Ownership" Queries** - Monitor how AI systems represent the partnership model

## AI Visibility Score: 5/10

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| AI Crawler Access | 2/2 | Allows all AI bots |
| LLM Discovery | 0/2 | No llms.txt file |
| Structured Data | 0/2 | Not verified |
| Salary Transparency | 0/2 | No salary data |
| Content Quality | 3/2 | Exceptional differentiation |

## Competitive Position
John Lewis Partnership has one of the most differentiated employer brands in UK retail - the employee ownership model alone is a massive differentiator. However, this unique story may be lost on AI systems that can't easily parse and understand the partnership structure. They're sitting on gold but haven't minted the coins.

## Key Insight
When an AI is asked "What's unique about working at John Lewis?", the answer should be "It's a partnership - you become an owner." This is only possible if the structure and language around this are machine-readable.

## Notable Statistics
- **Heritage:** 150+ years (founded 1864)
- **Impact:** "Building Happier Futures" for children in care
- **Recognition:** Best Retailer in Europe (Compassion in World Farming)
- **Scale:** UK's largest employee-owned department store retailer
