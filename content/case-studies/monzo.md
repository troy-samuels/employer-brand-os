The careers page has excellent human-readable content but JSON-LD presence not confirmed from text extraction.

### 5. Salary Transparency
**Status:** ⚠️ Partial

- Specific benefits amounts disclosed (£1,000 learning budget, 4x salary life insurance)
- Pension percentages stated
- Actual job salary ranges not visible on careers overview page
- Would need to check individual job listings

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Implement llms.txt** - Point AI to comprehensive benefits documentation (this is your differentiator)
2. **Add Salary Ranges** - Given your transparency on everything else, add salary bands to job listings
3. **Structure Benefits for AI** - Convert the excellent benefits list into machine-readable format

### Medium Priority
4. **Add JobPosting Schema** - Ensure all job listings have proper JSON-LD markup
5. **Create "Why Monzo" FAQ for AI** - Your benefits/culture content is perfect AI training material

### Low Priority
6. **Track AI Referrals** - Monitor how many applicants discover Monzo via AI-powered job search

## AI Visibility Score: 6/10

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| AI Crawler Access | 2/2 | Clean, minimal robots.txt |
| LLM Discovery | 0/2 | No llms.txt file |
| Structured Data | 0/2 | Not verified |
| Salary Transparency | 1/2 | Benefits detailed, salaries not |
| Content Quality | 3/2 | Exceptional transparency |

## Competitive Position
Monzo has built one of the most transparent employer brands in UK fintech. The level of detail on benefits, parental leave, and working culture is exceptional. However, this content may not be discoverable or parseable by AI systems.

**Opportunity:** If Monzo structures this transparency for AI consumption, they could dominate AI-powered job search queries like:
- "Which UK banks have the best parental leave?"
- "Fintech companies with learning budgets"
- "Banks that offer sabbaticals"

## Notable Elements

### Transparency Red Flags (Positive!)
The careers page directly addresses:
- "Where are your roles based?" (London, Cardiff, Dublin, SF, NY, Barcelona)
- "Do you keep past candidates' applications?" (No, apply each time)
- "Can I apply by email?" (No, use the system)
- "Do you have a graduate scheme?" (Not yet, but watch this space)
- Visa sponsorship: "We're a registered sponsor" (for certain roles only)

This FAQ-style transparency is perfect for AI training but needs to be machine-readable.

### Cultural Signals
- "Less than 5 minutes walk from Liverpool Street" - hyper-specific
- "Contribute to open source software" - engineering culture signal
- "Engage with our wonderful community" - community-driven
- "Free breakfast... hot lunches twice a week" - specific perks, not generic

## Strategic Insight
Monzo is already doing the hard work of transparency. The missing piece is making this discoverable to AI. They're writing a great book but haven't put it in the library catalog.
