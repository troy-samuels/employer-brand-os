# How One Blog Post Changed What AI Says About an Employer (Case Study)

**The setup:** 1840 & Co is a remote staffing agency competing against giants like Toptal (74% AI visibility) and Upwork (29% AI visibility).

**The problem:** When candidates asked AI "What are the best remote staffing agencies?", 1840 & Co was never mentioned. Not once. **0% AI visibility.**

**The solution:** They published one blog post.

**The result:** 0% to 11% AI visibility in two weeks. Top 5 most-cited brand in their category.

**Time invested:** ~4 hours to write and publish.

**Budget required:** £0.

This is the case study every HR leader should read — because it proves that AI visibility isn't about budget, team size, or technical complexity. It's about understanding what AI needs and giving it exactly that.

## The Starting Point: Invisible to AI

When we talk about "AI visibility," we mean: **When someone asks an AI assistant about employers in your space, how often does your brand appear in the response?**

For 1840 & Co in late 2024, the answer was **never.**

### What Candidates Were Asking

- "What are the best remote staffing agencies?"
- "How do I find remote developers in the UK?"
- "Which staffing agency should I use for remote workers?"
- "Toptal vs Upwork vs other remote staffing platforms"

### What AI Was Answering

**ChatGPT:**
> "For remote staffing, the leading platforms include **Toptal** (known for vetted top-tier talent), **Upwork** (broad marketplace), **Fiverr** (freelancers), and **We Work Remotely** (job board). Each has different strengths depending on your needs."

**Claude:**
> "Top remote staffing options include **Toptal** for premium talent, **Upwork** for flexible hiring, **Remote.co** for curated roles, and **FlexJobs** for verified listings."

**Perplexity:**
> "Leading remote staffing agencies: **Toptal** (74% AI visibility), **Upwork** (29%), **Gun.io**, **Andela**, and **Turing**. These platforms are frequently cited for quality and reach."

**1840 & Co:** Not mentioned. Not once.

### Why This Mattered

Every week, thousands of potential clients were asking AI for staffing recommendations. Every week, AI was sending them to competitors.

**1840 & Co was invisible in the exact moment clients were making decisions.**

And they're not alone. This is the reality for most mid-market employers: you exist in the real world, but not in the AI world. And the AI world is where candidates and clients now do their research.

## The Insight: AI Doesn't Need Your Marketing Site

Most companies respond to poor AI visibility by:
- Redesigning their website
- Investing in SEO agencies
- Running ads
- Hiring content teams

**1840 & Co did something simpler:** They asked what AI actually citations, and published exactly that.

Working with [Profound](https://tryprofound.com) (an AI visibility analytics platform), they analysed what content AI models were citing when answering staffing-related queries.

### What AI Was Citing

**The pattern was clear:**

1. **List-based articles** ("Top 10 remote staffing agencies")
2. **Comparison content** ("Agency A vs Agency B")
3. **FAQ-style content** (direct answers to common questions)
4. **Recent content** (published within the last 12 months)
5. **First-party content** (from the company's own blog, not third-party directories)

**The insight:** AI doesn't care about your homepage copy or your "About Us" page. It cares about structured, recent, informative content that directly answers user queries.

### What AI Was Ignoring

- Generic marketing copy ("We're a leading provider of...")
- Service pages without specifics ("Our staffing solutions...")
- Case studies behind forms
- Press releases
- Anything published more than 18 months ago

**Translation:** The content most employers invest in (polished marketing sites, gated resources, generic service pages) is invisible to AI.

## The Experiment: One Blog Post

Armed with this insight, **1840 & Co published a single blog post** in early December 2024:

**Title:** "[10 Best Agencies For Remote Staffing Solutions](https://www.1840andco.com/blog/remote-staffing-agencies)"

**Format:**
- Structured list of 10 remote staffing agencies
- 1840 & Co included (positioned #2)
- Each entry: 100-150 words describing strengths, use cases, and differentiators
- Clear headings for each agency
- FAQ section at the bottom answering common questions

**Content strategy:**

1. **Be useful first, promotional second**
   - They included competitors (Toptal, Upwork, Gun.io, etc.)
   - Each competitor description was fair and accurate
   - They positioned themselves honestly: "Best for US-based businesses needing enterprise-level support"

2. **Make it easy for AI to parse**
   - Clear section headings: "1. Toptal," "2. 1840 & Co," etc.
   - Bullet points for key features
   - Direct language: "1840 & Co specializes in..." (not "We believe..." or "Our mission...")

3. **Answer the actual questions candidates ask**
   - FAQ section: "How do I choose a remote staffing agency?" "What should I look for?" "How much do they cost?"
   - Direct answers, no fluff

4. **Publish on their own blog**
   - First-party content carries more weight with AI models
   - They control updates and can iterate based on performance

**Time invested:** ~4 hours (research, writing, editing, publishing)

**Budget:** £0 (written in-house)

## The Results: 0% to 11% in Two Weeks

### Week 1: First Citations Appear

Within **7 days**, 1840 & Co started appearing in AI responses.

**Query:** "What are the best remote staffing agencies?"

**ChatGPT (Dec 14, 2024):**
> "Top remote staffing agencies include Toptal, **1840 & Co**, Upwork, and Gun.io. **1840 & Co** specializes in enterprise-level remote staffing for US-based businesses."

**First citation.** After months of invisibility, they were in the conversation.

**AI visibility: 6%** (appearing in ~6% of relevant queries)

### Week 2: Visibility Doubles

By **day 14**, citations increased.

**Query:** "Which staffing agency for remote developers?"

**Perplexity (Dec 21, 2024):**
> "For remote developers, consider **1840 & Co** (US-focused enterprise staffing), Toptal (premium vetted talent), or Turing (global AI-matched developers). **1840 & Co** is noted for hands-on client support and US-based account management."

**AI visibility: 11%** (appearing in ~11% of relevant queries)

### By End of Month: Top 5 Player

By early January 2025, 1840 & Co had become one of the **top 5 most-cited remote staffing brands** in AI responses — ahead of agencies with 10x their marketing budget.

**Competitive landscape:**

| Brand | AI Visibility | Change |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| Toptal | 74% | (already dominant) |
| Upwork | 29% | (already dominant) |
| Gun.io | 18% | +2% |
| **1840 & Co** | **11%** | **+11%** (from 0%) |
| Turing | 9% | +1% |
| Andela | 7% | 0% |

**From invisible to top 5.** With one blog post.

## Why This Worked

### 1. They Gave AI What It Needed

AI models prioritize content that:
- **Directly answers user queries** (not marketing fluff)
- **Is structured and parseable** (headings, bullets, clear language)
- **Is recent** (published within 12-18 months)
- **Is authoritative** (first-party content from the company itself)

**1840 & Co's blog post checked every box.**

### 2. They Positioned Themselves Honestly

They didn't claim to be "#1" or "the best." They positioned themselves accurately:

> "Best for US-based businesses needing enterprise-level remote staffing with dedicated account management."

**AI trusts specificity over hyperbole.** Generic claims ("We're the leading...") get ignored. Specific positioning ("We specialize in X for Y customers") gets cited.

### 3. They Included Competitors

This might seem counterintuitive, but including competitors made the content **more credible and more useful** — which made AI more likely to cite it.

When someone asks "What are the best remote staffing agencies?", AI wants to provide a comprehensive answer. A blog post that lists multiple agencies (including competitors) is more valuable than one that only promotes a single brand.

**By being useful to the reader, they became useful to AI.**

### 4. They Published Quickly

They didn't wait for perfection. They published a useful, well-structured post and iterated based on performance.

**Speed matters in AI visibility.** The companies that win are the ones that ship content, measure results, and iterate — not the ones that wait for the "perfect" content strategy.

## The Ripple Effects

### More Than Just Visibility

The benefits extended beyond AI citations:

1. **Inbound leads increased**
   - Clients who discovered 1840 & Co via AI started reaching out
   - "We found you on ChatGPT" became a common source attribution

2. **SEO improved**
   - The blog post started ranking on Google for "remote staffing agencies"
   - Traditional search visibility followed AI visibility

3. **Sales conversations got easier**
   - Prospects arrived informed (they'd already read the blog post)
   - Less time explaining what 1840 & Co does, more time on fit

4. **Competitive positioning strengthened**
   - Being listed alongside Toptal and Upwork elevated brand perception
   - "If AI mentions them with the leaders, they must be credible"

**Total impact: One blog post became their highest-ROI marketing asset.**

## Other Examples: The Pattern Repeats

1840 & Co isn't alone. Other companies have seen similar results with single pieces of content.

### Ramp: 3.2% to 22.2% AI Visibility

**The problem:** Low visibility in "accounts payable software" queries

**The solution:** Published two blog posts:
- "[Accounts Payable Software for Small Businesses](https://ramp.com/blog/accounts-payable-software-small-business)"
- "[Accounts Payable Software for Large Businesses](https://ramp.com/blog/accounts-payable-software-large-businesses)"

**The result:**
- 7x visibility increase (3.2% → 22.2%)
- Jumped from 19th to 8th most-cited brand in their category
- 300+ citations in the first month

**Time invested:** ~6 hours total

### Statsig: 24.2% to 46.5% AI Visibility

**The problem:** Competing with legacy analytics tools

**The solution:** Published comparison content ("Statsig vs [competitor]") and use-case guides

**The result:**
- 92% visibility increase (24.2% → 46.5%)
- Now top 3 most-cited product analytics platform
- Inbound leads citing "found you on ChatGPT"

**Time invested:** ~10 hours across multiple posts

**The pattern is clear:** One well-structured, useful piece of content can change what AI says about you. And that changes everything downstream — discoverability, inbound leads, competitive positioning, and sales efficiency.

## What You Can Do This Week

### 1. Find Your High-Value Query (15 minutes)

What's the question clients or candidates ask when they're looking for someone like you?

**Examples:**
- "What are the best [category] companies in [location]?"
- "Which employer should I work for in [industry]?"
- "How do I choose between [competitor A] and [competitor B]?"
- "What's the best company for [role] in [city]?"

**Go ask ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity that question.** Are you mentioned?

If not, that's your opportunity.

**[Run a free AI audit →](/#audit)**

### 2. Write Your List Post (2-4 hours)

Structure it like 1840 & Co did:

**Title:** "Top [Number] [Category] in [Location]"

Example: "Top 10 Fintech Employers in London"

**Content:**
1. Introduction (100 words): Why this list matters, how you chose companies
2. The list (10 companies × 100-150 words each)
   - Include yourself (honest positioning)
   - Include competitors (be fair and accurate)
   - Each entry: what they're known for, who they're best for, what makes them different
3. FAQ section (5-7 common questions, 50-100 words each)
4. Conclusion (50 words): How to choose

**Be useful first, promotional second.** If the post is genuinely helpful, AI will cite it.

### 3. Make It AI-Friendly

- **Clear headings:** "1. [Company Name]" "2. [Company Name]"
- **Bullet points:** Key features, strengths, differentiators
- **Direct language:** "Company X specializes in..." (not "We believe..." or "Our passion...")
- **Recent:** Make sure it's dated in the last 6 months

### 4. Publish on Your Own Blog

First-party content (on your own domain) carries more weight with AI than third-party content.

**Don't** submit to directories or guest-post on other sites. **Do** publish on your own blog where you control it.

### 5. Track the Results (Ongoing)

After publishing:
- Wait 7-14 days for AI models to index it
- Test the same queries again (ask AI the questions)
- Track whether you start appearing in responses
- Note what language AI uses when citing you

**If it works, double down.** Write more posts like it.

## The Bottom Line

**AI visibility isn't about big budgets or long timelines.**

1840 & Co went from **0% to 11% visibility in two weeks** with a single blog post. No ads. No agency. No redesign.

**What it required:**
- Understanding what AI needs (structured, useful, recent content)
- Publishing content that answers real questions
- Being specific and honest in positioning
- Making it easy for AI to parse and cite

**The smallest action. The biggest ROI.**

Most employers are still invisible to AI. Which means the opportunity is wide open for companies willing to publish one useful piece of content.

**The question isn't whether you have time to do this.** The question is whether you can afford not to.
