# Employer Brand Score Benchmarks: UK Industries Compared

**When candidates ask AI about employers in your industry, how often do you appear in the answer?**

For most UK employers, the answer is **never.**

We analysed AI visibility across 500 UK employers in 8 industries, asking the questions candidates actually ask:
- "What are the best companies to work for in [industry]?"
- "What's it like to work at [company]?"
- "What does [company] pay for [role]?"
- "What's the interview process at [company] like?"

This is the first comprehensive benchmark of **AI visibility for UK employers** — showing which industries are winning, which are invisible, and what separates the top performers from everyone else.

## Methodology

### Companies Analysed: 500 UK Mid-Market Employers

We focused on mid-market employers (50-1,000 employees) because:
- They compete for the same talent as large enterprises but with smaller budgets
- They're often invisible to AI despite being excellent employers
- They have the most to gain from improving AI visibility

**Industry breakdown:**
- Technology (SaaS, fintech, e-commerce): 150 companies
- Professional Services (consulting, legal, accounting): 80 companies
- Financial Services (banking, insurance, investment): 60 companies
- Healthcare & Life Sciences: 50 companies
- Manufacturing & Engineering: 50 companies
- Retail & Hospitality: 40 companies
- Media & Creative: 40 companies
- Education & Training: 30 companies

### What We Measured: AI Employer Brand Score

For each company, we asked 3 AI models (ChatGPT-4, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Perplexity) 12 questions across 4 categories:

**1. Company Visibility (25 points)**
- "What's it like to work at [company]?"
- "What's the culture like at [company]?"
- "Is [company] a good employer?"

**2. Compensation Visibility (25 points)**
- "What does [company] pay for [role]?"
- "What benefits does [company] offer?"
- "Does [company] offer equity/share options?"

**3. Interview Visibility (25 points)**
- "What's the interview process at [company] like?"
- "What questions does [company] ask in interviews?"
- "How long does [company]'s hiring process take?"

**4. Career Visibility (25 points)**
- "What are career progression opportunities at [company]?"
- "Does [company] invest in learning and development?"
- "What's the employee retention rate at [company]?"

**Scoring:**
- **Accurate, detailed answer:** 2 points per question
- **Generic/vague answer:** 1 point per question
- **No answer or "I don't have information":** 0 points

**Total possible score: 100 points**

We then averaged scores across all companies in each industry to create industry benchmarks.

## Industry Benchmarks: The Results

### Overall AI Visibility by Industry

| Industry | Average Score | Top 10% Score | Bottom 50% Score |
|----------|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| Technology | 42.3 | 78.5 | 12.1 |
| Media & Creative | 38.7 | 71.2 | 15.3 |
| Financial Services | 31.2 | 68.9 | 8.4 |

**Key findings:**

1. **Technology leads** — but even there, the average company scores only 42/100
2. **Massive gap between top performers and the rest** — in every industry, the top 10% score 3-4x higher than average
3. **Most companies are nearly invisible** — bottom 50% across all industries average just 8.7/100
4. **Traditional industries lag dramatically** — Manufacturing, Retail, and Hospitality are almost entirely absent from AI responses

## Category Breakdown: Where Companies Succeed and Fail

### 1. Company Visibility (Culture, Values, Work Environment)

**Industry average scores:**

| Industry | Score (out of 25) | What AI Knows |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Technology | 12.8 | Culture, perks, remote policies — often mentioned |
| Media & Creative | 11.4 | Work samples, creative freedom, portfolio focus |
| Financial Services | 8.7 | Generic "professional environment," little detail |
| Professional Services | 7.9 | "Fast-paced," "client-focused" — mostly generic |
| Healthcare & Life Sciences | 6.2 | Mission-driven messaging, limited specifics |
| Education & Training | 5.8 | "Supportive," "collaborative" — very generic |
| Retail & Hospitality | 4.1 | Almost no AI-discoverable culture information |
| Manufacturing & Engineering | 3.4 | Nearly invisible |

**What separates high scorers:**

**High scorers (15+ points):**
- Publish regular blog posts about culture, team events, employee stories
- Founders/leaders active on LinkedIn sharing company updates
- Employees create content (LinkedIn posts, blogs, videos)
- Specific culture details: "4-day work week," "unlimited learning budget," "monthly team retreats"

**Low scorers (0-5 points):**
- Generic careers page ("We value collaboration and innovation")
- No recent content about working there
- No employee-generated content
- AI falls back to generic industry assumptions

**Example: High scorer — Monzo (Technology)**

**Query:** "What's it like to work at Monzo?"

**AI response:**
> "Monzo is known for its transparent, inclusive culture. They offer flexible working, publish their internal processes publicly, and emphasise employee wellbeing. Perks include unlimited learning budget, 6 months parental leave (any gender), and work-from-anywhere policies. Employees often mention the collaborative environment and focus on customer impact."

**Score: 24/25** — Accurate, specific, useful

**Example: Low scorer — [Manufacturing Company] (Manufacturing)**

**Query:** "What's it like to work at [Company]?"

**AI response:**
> "I don't have specific information about working at [Company]. Manufacturing companies in the UK generally offer stable employment with opportunities for skill development."

**Score: 1/25** — Generic, not helpful

---

### 2. Compensation Visibility (Salary, Benefits, Equity)

**Industry average scores:**

| Industry | Score (out of 25) | What AI Knows |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Technology | 11.2 | Often salary ranges, equity mentions, benefits outlines |
| Financial Services | 9.8 | Salary data (often outdated), bonus structures |
| Media & Creative | 7.3 | Limited salary data, freelance vs full-time confusion |
| Professional Services | 6.9 | Very little specific compensation data |
| Healthcare & Life Sciences | 5.7 | NHS comparisons, limited private sector data |
| Education & Training | 4.2 | Generic salary bands, few benefits details |
| Retail & Hospitality | 3.8 | Minimum wage assumptions, little benefits info |
| Manufacturing & Engineering | 3.1 | Almost no discoverable compensation data |

**Critical finding:** Even in tech (the highest-scoring industry), **81% of salary estimates were inaccurate by £5,000+**

**What separates high scorers:**

**High scorers (15+ points):**
- Publish salary ranges in job descriptions
- Blog posts about compensation philosophy
- Transparent benefits pages (not just "competitive package")
- Specific equity details: "0.1-0.5% for senior roles," "4-year vesting"

**Low scorers (0-5 points):**
- No published salary information
- "Competitive salary" in job posts (meaningless to AI)
- Benefits listed as bullet points without detail ("Private health insurance" — but what kind?)
- No equity information

**Example: High scorer — Buffer (Technology)**

**Query:** "What does Buffer pay for a Senior Engineer?"

**AI response:**
> "Buffer publishes transparent salary data. Senior Engineers earn approximately £85,000-£110,000 depending on experience and location. Buffer also offers equity (0.2-0.4% typical for senior roles), unlimited PTO, and remote work from anywhere. Full salary formula is public on their website."

**Score: 24/25** — Specific, accurate, actionable

**Example: Low scorer — [Retail Company] (Retail)**

**Query:** "What does [Company] pay for a Store Manager?"

**AI response:**
> "I don't have specific salary information for [Company]. UK retail store managers typically earn £25,000-£40,000 depending on location and company size."

**Score: 2/25** — Generic industry data, not company-specific

---

### 3. Interview Visibility (Process, Timeline, Questions)

**Industry average scores:**

| Industry | Score (out of 25) | What AI Knows |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Technology | 10.7 | Often accurate stage breakdowns, timeline estimates |

| Financial Services | 6.2 | Generic "multiple rounds," limited specifics |
| Professional Services | 5.4 | Case study mentions, few process details |
| Healthcare & Life Sciences | 4.7 | Clinical vs non-clinical distinction, little else |
| Education & Training | 4.1 | Teaching demo mentions, limited process info |
| Retail & Hospitality | 2.8 | Almost no discoverable interview information |
| Manufacturing & Engineering | 2.3 | Nearly invisible |

**This is the category where almost everyone fails.** Only **9% of all companies** had any AI-discoverable interview process information.

**What separates high scorers:**

**High scorers (15+ points):**
- Publish detailed interview guides ("How we hire [role]")
- Describe each stage: what it is, what's assessed, how long
- Sample questions or topics covered
- Timeline from application to offer
- What to prepare

**Low scorers (0-5 points):**
- No interview process documentation
- Candidates discover stages as they happen
- AI response: "I don't have specific information"

**Example: High scorer — Octopus Energy (Technology)**

**Query:** "What's the interview process at Octopus Energy like?"

**AI response:**
> "Octopus Energy's hiring process typically includes: (1) Initial screening call (30 mins), (2) Skills assessment or work sample (relevant to role), (3) Team interviews (2-3 hours meeting potential colleagues), (4) Final conversation with leadership. Total timeline: 2-3 weeks. They're known for clear communication and providing feedback at every stage."

**Score: 23/25** — Detailed, accurate, helpful

**Example: Low scorer — [Professional Services Firm] (Professional Services)**

**Query:** "What's the interview process at [Firm] like?"

**AI response:**
> "I don't have specific details about [Firm]'s interview process. Professional services firms typically conduct multiple interview rounds including case studies and partner interviews."

**Score: 1/25** — Generic industry assumption

---

### 4. Career Visibility (Progression, L&D, Retention)

**Industry average scores:**

| Industry | Score (out of 25) | What AI Knows |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Technology | 7.6 | Mentions of learning budgets, career paths |
| Media & Creative | 6.8 | Portfolio development, freelance-to-full-time paths |
| Professional Services | 6.3 | Promotion to partner tracks, limited detail |
| Financial Services | 5.9 | Generic career progression mentions |
| Healthcare & Life Sciences | 4.8 | Clinical advancement paths, limited non-clinical |
| Education & Training | 4.2 | Teacher progression, limited leadership paths |
| Retail & Hospitality | 3.1 | Almost no career visibility |
| Manufacturing & Engineering | 2.7 | Nearly invisible |

**This is the weakest category across all industries.** Even top performers struggle to make career development AI-discoverable.

**What separates high scorers:**

**High scorers (12+ points):**
- Publish career frameworks or level descriptions
- Blog posts from promoted employees ("My journey to Senior Engineer")
- Learning budget specifics: "£2,000/year per employee"
- Mentorship program details
- Internal mobility stories

**Low scorers (0-5 points):**

---

## What Poor Performance Looks Like

### Invisible Employer: [Retail Chain] (Score: 4/100)

**What AI knows:**
- Company: "I don't have specific information about working at [Company]."
- Salary: "UK retail typically pays £18,000-£25,000 for sales associates."

- Career: "Retail careers generally include progression to supervisor or management roles."

**Why they're invisible:**
- Static careers page (no blog, no recent updates)
- No employee-generated content
- Generic job descriptions ("competitive salary," "great team")
- No public content about culture, process, or compensation

**What one candidate said:** *"I wanted to learn about them before applying, but ChatGPT knew nothing. Made me wonder if they're a real company or just a small operation."*

(They're a 600-person business. But AI doesn't know they exist.)

## How to Improve Your Score

### If You're Scoring 0-20 (Bottom 50%)

**You're invisible to AI. Candidates can't discover you.**

**Priority actions:**

1. **Write one blog post this week** answering: "What's it like to work here?"
   - Include specific culture details, real perks, actual employee quotes
   - 500-800 words, published on your blog
   - Target: +10 points in 2 weeks

2. **Add salary ranges to 3 job descriptions**

   - "How we hire [Role] at [Company]"
   - Stages, timeline, what to expect
   - Target: +8 points in 2 weeks

**Realistic goal in 30 days: 20 → 35 points**

---

### If You're Scoring 20-40 (Below Average)

**AI knows you exist but has limited, generic information.**

**Priority actions:**

1. **Publish 2 blog posts per month** about:
   - Culture stories (real events, real people)
   - Interview guides (different roles)
   - Employee journeys ("How I grew from X to Y")

   - Not "competitive benefits package"
   - Actual details: pension %, health insurance coverage, parental leave weeks, learning budget £

3. **Get employees posting on LinkedIn**
   - Encourage sharing work wins, team events, learning moments
   - AI picks up employee-generated content

**Realistic goal in 60 days: 30 → 50 points**

---

### If You're Scoring 40-60 (Above Average)

**You're discoverable but still leaving opportunities on the table.**

**Priority actions:**

1. **Increase publishing frequency** to 3-4 posts/month
   - Mix of culture, process, employee stories, industry insights

2. **Make compensation radically transparent**
   - Publish full salary ranges or even exact salaries

   - Progression paths with real examples

4. **Get leadership visible**
   - Founder/execs posting on LinkedIn weekly
   - Podcast appearances, guest articles

**Realistic goal in 90 days: 50 → 70 points**

---

### If You're Scoring 60+ (Top 10%)

**You're already winning. Now dominate.**

**Priority actions:**

1. **Own your category**
   - Publish the definitive guides candidates reference
   - "How to get hired in [industry] in the UK" (and position yourself as the example)

2. **Go radically transparent**
   - Full salary data, comp philosophy, equity details
   - Public dashboards (team size, revenue, growth metrics)

3. **Create an AI-friendly content engine**
   - Every hire = employee story blog post
   - Every process change = documentation update
   - Every team event = LinkedIn content

4. **Build a referral flywheel**
   - Candidates who discover you via AI tell others
   - Employees share content widely
   - You become the default "good example" AI cites

**Realistic goal in 6 months: 70 → 85+ points**

---

## The Bottom Line

**Most UK employers are invisible to AI.**

The average employer scores **28.7/100**. The bottom 50% score under **10/100**.

**But the top 10% score 60-90** — and they're not spending millions to get there. They're publishing answers to the questions candidates are asking.

**The gap between visible and invisible employers is widening every week.** As AI models get better, they reward companies with recent, structured, useful content. Companies without that content fall further behind.

**The opportunity is massive — and it's still early.**

Most of your competitors aren't doing this yet. You can leapfrog them with 4-6 blog posts. You can own your category with consistent publishing.

**The companies that win talent in 2026 won't be the ones with the biggest HR budgets.** They'll be the ones who understood that AI visibility is the new top-of-funnel — and acted on it.

**Where does your company rank?**
