# Rankwell — Investor One-Pager
*AI Reputation Intelligence for Employers*

---

## The Problem

**800 million people use ChatGPT every week.** When candidates ask "What's it like to work at [Company]?", AI answers instantly — pulling from Glassdoor reviews, LinkedIn, and Indeed. The company's own careers page is never cited.

- **78% of AI salary estimates are inaccurate** (our research, 500 UK employers)
- **85.6% of job seekers now use AI to research employers** (Huntr Q3 2025)
- **Company careers pages appear in only 12% of AI responses**
- **15% of large employers suffer entity confusion** — AI confuses them with similarly-named companies

The employer brand industry spends **$17 billion annually** on careers pages, job ads, and employer marketing. None of it is optimised for how AI retrieves and presents information.

## The Solution

**Rankwell maps how AI describes employers and fixes the gaps.**

### Product Stack:
1. **Free Audit** (lead gen) — Shows what AI says about your company, where it gets its data, and what's wrong. 30 seconds.
2. **Weekly Monitor** ($49/mo) — Track your AI reputation score, get alerts on changes, Monday email digest.
3. **Smart Pixel** ($899/mo) — JavaScript snippet that injects real-time structured data (JSON-LD) into careers pages, ensuring AI models always have fresh, accurate information.

### What makes us different:
- **Only tool built specifically for employer branding** (competitors are generic brand monitoring)
- **Full-stack: audit + monitor + fix** (competitors only monitor)
- **Smart Pixel** is unique technology — real-time structured data injection
- **Evidence-based scoring** backed by peer-reviewed research (Princeton, Digital Bloom, Senthor)
