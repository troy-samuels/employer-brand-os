## Objection Handling

**"Why not just use Otterly/Profound?"**
→ They only tell you the problem. We tell you the problem AND fix it. Monitoring without action is just a dashboard that makes you anxious.

**"We already have an employer brand agency"**
→ Great — they handle the creative. We handle the technical infrastructure that makes sure AI actually finds and cites your content. Complementary, not competitive.

**"AI search is too new to invest in"**
→ 85% of job seekers already use AI to research employers. The companies that optimise now will dominate the AI citation landscape for years. First-mover advantage is real.

**"We can do this ourselves with structured data"**
→ You could. But our Smart Pixel automates it, keeps it fresh, and monitors the results. It's like building your own analytics vs. using Google Analytics. You could, but why would you?

**"Your scoring methodology might not be accurate"**
→ It's based on the Princeton GEO study, Digital Bloom's 7,000-citation analysis, and Senthor's 10M-request dataset. We're the only tool that's thrown out recommendations the research disproved (llms.txt). We follow the evidence.

**"£899/month is too expensive"**
→ One mis-hired candidate costs £15,000-£30,000. If AI misinformation is causing even 2% of candidates to not apply, the maths works in your favour in the first week.
