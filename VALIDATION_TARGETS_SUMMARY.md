## Why These Companies?

### They all have:
✅ 100-500 employees (right size for validation)  
✅ UK headquarters or strong UK presence  
✅ 5+ live roles on careers pages (actively hiring)  
✅ Glassdoor presence with 2.5-4.5 ratings (enough data for AI, but imperfect)  
✅ Clear employer brand gaps that OpenRole can solve

### Common pain points we can address:
- **AI invisibility** - most don't surface well in ChatGPT/Claude when candidates research them
- **Glassdoor issues** - old negative reviews still appear in AI summaries
- **Thin careers content** - generic job descriptions, minimal culture storytelling
- **Competitive gaps** - losing talent to competitors with stronger employer brands
- **Scale mismatch** - fast growth but employer brand hasn't kept pace

## Next Steps

1. **Select 5-10 priority companies** from the list (diversify across sectors)
2. **Research exact decision-maker names** via LinkedIn for those targets
3. **Draft personalized cold emails** using the hooks provided
4. **Send audit offers** - free employer brand audit powered by OpenRole
