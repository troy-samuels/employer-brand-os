## The Market Opportunity

The AI SEO tools market has reached **$2.2 billion** (2025), with the GEO (Generative Engine Optimisation) segment growing at **34% CAGR** — one of the fastest-growing B2B software categories. By 2028, McKinsey projects **$750 billion in US revenue** will funnel through AI-powered search.

The broader context: **60% of Google searches now end without a click** (Bain & Company). AI Overviews reduce organic CTR for #1 positions by **58%** (Ahrefs, Feb 2026). Google AI Overviews reach **2 billion monthly users**. ChatGPT has **700 million weekly active users**. Yet AI search visitors are **4.4x more valuable** than traditional organic visitors.

## The Employer Brand Angle — Why Rankwell Wins

**80% of job seekers** now use ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini to research companies (PerceptionX). AI-driven traffic to career sites surged **1,300%** in the last 6 months. Yet **no purpose-built tool** exists for TA teams to manage their AI employer brand.

The Rally Recruitment Marketing webinar (Jan 2026) stated: *"For TA, there's really only one built specifically for this. So the gap isn't just knowledge — it's infrastructure."*

**Rankwell's white space:** The intersection of AI search optimisation × employer brand. Competitors serve either general marketing (Profound, Otterly, Peec AI — collectively $29M+ funded) or traditional employer brand (Glassdoor, LinkedIn — no AI search capability). PerceptionX is the only near-competitor, but focuses on measurement over optimisation.

## Key Findings

| Finding | Implication for Rankwell |
|---------|-------------------------|
| 35% of Gen Z use AI chatbots for search | Your core talent audience is AI-native |
| AI visitors are 4.4x more valuable | Small gains in AI visibility = outsized recruiting impact |
| Only 25% content overlap between AI platforms | Platform-specific monitoring is essential (already a Rankwell feature) |
| Structured data improves AI citation by 30–40% | Rankwell's verification page + schema.org generation is a massive moat |
| 86% of SEOs use AI, but only 19% do GEO | Huge awareness gap = content marketing opportunity |
| Gartner: 50% organic traffic decline by 2028 | Urgency driver for enterprise sales |

## Top 5 Opportunities (90-Day Horizon)

1. **Launch Candidate Prompt Library** — Curate 200+ prompts candidates use when asking AI about employers. No competitor has this. Creates proprietary data advantage.

2. **Build GEO Audit Tool** — Analyse an employer's AI readiness (career site, Glassdoor, schema markup, review sentiment) and generate actionable recommendations. The free audit already exists; expand it into ongoing monitoring.

3. **Publish "AI Employer Brand Index"** — Score and rank top 100+ UK employers on AI visibility. Instant PR, backlinks, thought leadership. Semrush's AI statistics report gets massive traffic.

4. **Structured Data Publisher** — Generate machine-readable employer profiles (schema.org/JSON-LD) that AI models can reliably reference. This is the "verification page" evolution — make Rankwell the employer's source of truth for AI.

5. **Agency Tier Launch** — 75% of agencies now offer GEO services (MktClarity). Create a £999–£1,499/mo multi-client tier for recruitment agencies managing employer brands.

## Immediate Actions

| Action | Owner | Timeline |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Publish "What Does ChatGPT Say About Your Company?" blog post | Content | Week 1 |
| Run free audits on 100 UK employers, compile benchmark data | Product | Weeks 1–3 |
| Add AI crawler monitoring to dashboard | Engineering | Weeks 2–4 |
| Submit Rankwell for G2 AEO category listing | Marketing | Week 1 |
| Create schema.org generator for verification pages | Engineering | Weeks 3–6 |
| Develop agency pricing tier | Product/Sales | Weeks 4–6 |
| Publish "State of AI Employer Brand Q1 2026" report | Content/PR | Week 8 |

## Competitive Positioning Summary

**Rankwell's moat = employer brand + AI search + free instant audit + weekly monitoring.** No competitor combines all four. Protect the free audit (conversion weapon), own the "AI Employer Brand Score" category term, and expand from monitoring to active optimisation tooling.

The window is 12–18 months before general-purpose AI SEO platforms (Profound, Otterly, Semrush) add employer-brand-specific features or PerceptionX scales. Move fast.
