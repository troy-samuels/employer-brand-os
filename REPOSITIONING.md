# OpenRole Repositioning — February 2026

## The Shift

**From:** "Is AI telling the truth about your company?" (defensive, vague)
**To:** "Take control of what AI tells your candidates." (empowering, actionable)

**From:** Technical audit tool that checks your website
**To:** AI Employer Intelligence platform that shows gaps, gives playbooks, and tracks progress

## Competitive Positioning

| | PerceptionX | Built In | OpenRole |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Buyer** | Enterprise TA/EB | Enterprise TA | UK Mid-market TA/HR |
| **Geography** | US-centric | US-only, tech-only | UK-first, all sectors |
| **Pricing** | "Book a Demo" | "Book a Demo" | £49/£149/£399 published |
| **Entry point** | No free tool | Free reputation report | Free instant audit |
| **Scoring** | Fluffy themes (18) | AI visibility score | Factual accuracy gaps |
| **Actionability** | Low — diagnose only | Medium — profiles | High — content playbook + templates |
| **Public index** | Yes (Visibility Index) | Yes (Best Places) | **BUILD THIS** |

### Our Wedge
PerceptionX tells you "your culture visibility is 62%." Meaningless.
OpenRole tells you "AI says you pay £55K. You actually pay £75K. Here's the paragraph to add to your careers page this week." Actionable.

## New Site Architecture

### Navigation
```
OpenRole (logo)  |  Index  |  Audit  |  How It Works  |  Pricing  |  Blog  |  Login
```

### Pages

#### 1. Homepage (/)
**Headline:** "Take control of what AI tells your candidates"
**Subhead:** "80% of candidates ask ChatGPT about you before applying. See what it says — free."
**CTA:** Company search input → instant audit

**Sections (in order):**
1. Hero + audit input
2. "The Problem" — stat-driven (80% use AI, 68% have wrong salary data, avg score 32/100)
3. Before/After ChatGPT comparison (KEEP — this is excellent)
4. How It Works — 3 steps: Audit → Gap Report → Content Playbook
5. Monday Report preview (KEEP — 3D tilt card is great)
6. UK Visibility Index teaser — "See who AI recommends in your industry"
7. Pricing
8. Bottom CTA

#### 2. UK Visibility Index (/index)
**The growth engine.** Public, free, no signup.

- Industry selector (Fintech, Healthcare, SaaS, Retail, etc.)
- Top 20 employers per industry ranked by AI visibility
- Scored across 8 factual themes (not 18 fluffy ones):
  1. Salary Accuracy
  2. Benefits Completeness  
  3. Remote/Hybrid Policy Clarity
  4. Interview Process Transparency
  5. Tech Stack Discoverability
  6. Career Growth Pathways
  7. DEI Commitments
  8. Company Culture Specificity
- Each company card shows: score, themes strong/weak, "Run full audit" CTA
- Updated monthly
- SEO: /index/fintech, /index/healthcare, /index/retail etc.

**Why this matters:** Every HR director searching "best fintech employers UK AI" finds us. They see their competitors ranked above them. They click "Run audit" on their own company. Pipeline.

#### 3. Free Audit (/audit or /#audit)
**KEEP but enhance.** Current audit checks the website. New audit also:
- Queries 4 AI models with candidate questions
- Shows ACTUAL AI responses (like PerceptionX promises but we deliver instantly)
- Highlights factual errors (wrong salary, missing benefits, outdated info)
- Generates Information Gap Report showing what AI CAN'T answer
- Teases the full playbook (gated behind signup/payment)

#### 4. How It Works (/how-it-works)
Expanded version of the 3-step flow:

**Step 1: See what AI says (Free)**
Enter your company → we query ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini with real candidate questions → you see the actual answers, word for word, with sources cited.

**Step 2: Find the gaps (Free report)**
We show you what AI CAN'T answer: salary bands, specific benefits, interview process, remote policy, tech stack. These are the questions where Glassdoor has nothing — and neither do you.

**Step 3: Fill the gaps (Paid plans)**
Content Playbook: exactly what to publish, where, and how to format it. Templates included. Track progress weekly as AI starts citing YOUR content instead of guessing.

#### 5. Pricing (/pricing)
**Revised tiers reflecting the new value prop:**

**Free — Always**
- Unlimited AI audits
- See what 4 AI models say about any company
- Basic gap summary

**Starter — £49/mo**
- Weekly AI monitoring (4 models)
- Full Information Gap Report
- 5 content templates per month
- Email alerts when AI changes answers

**Growth — £149/mo ⭐**
- Everything in Starter
- Content Playbook (what to publish, where, how)
- Competitor benchmarking (vs 2 rivals)
- Interview prep monitoring (what candidates see before your interviews)
- Priority in UK Visibility Index listing

**Scale — £399/mo**
- Everything in Growth
- Unlimited competitor benchmarks
- Done-for-you content drafts (monthly)
- API for ATS/careers page integration
- Custom reporting for board/leadership

#### 6. Blog (/blog)
Publish immediately:
- "What ChatGPT tells candidates about Monzo — and why it's right" (case study from our research)
- "Why your Lever careers page is invisible to AI" (ATS analysis)
- "The 20 questions candidates ask AI before applying" (steal from PerceptionX's title, do it better)
- "UK Employer AI Visibility: 2026 State of Play" (our index data)

#### 7. Company Pages (/company/[slug])
Public profile for every company in the index. Shows:
- AI Visibility Score
- Theme breakdown
- What AI says (sampled quotes)
- "Claim this profile" CTA (leads to signup)
- Compare with competitors

## Messaging Changes

### Old → New

| Element | Old | New |
|---|---|---|
| **Headline** | "Is AI telling the truth about your company?" | "Take control of what AI tells your candidates" |
| **Subhead** | "Find out in 30 seconds. Completely free." | "80% of candidates ask AI about you before applying. See what they hear." |
| **Value prop** | See your score / Fix the gaps / Prove it weekly | See what AI says / Find what's missing / Fill the gaps with your truth |
| **Features copy** | "Instant AI reputation audit across every model" | "See the actual AI responses candidates get about your salary, culture, and benefits" |
| **Pricing headline** | "Cheaper than one bad hire" | "One wrong salary in ChatGPT costs you a hire. Fix it for £49/mo." |
| **Social proof line** | "75 UK employers audited · Average score: 32/100" | "340+ UK employers tracked · 68% have wrong salary data in AI · Average score: 32/100" |

### Key Messaging Principles (from Gemini + our research)
1. **Sell the pain, not the tech** — "AI is telling candidates the wrong salary" not "we optimise your llms.txt"
2. **Information Gain, not reputation management** — We don't fight Glassdoor on opinions. We own the facts they can't provide.
3. **Specificity beats abstraction** — "Your salary is wrong in ChatGPT" > "Your employer brand needs work"
4. **Shock and consult** — The free audit should genuinely surprise people
5. **Actionable > diagnostic** — Every insight comes with a "here's what to do about it" template

## What We're NOT Doing
- ❌ "Book a Demo" gatekeeping — everything has published pricing
- ❌ 18 fluffy themes — we score on factual accuracy, not vibes
- ❌ Enterprise-only positioning — mid-market UK is our home
- ❌ Pretending to be a consultancy — we're a product
- ❌ Fighting Glassdoor on sentiment — we own the facts
- ❌ Promising to "fix" AI responses — we give you the playbook to take control
